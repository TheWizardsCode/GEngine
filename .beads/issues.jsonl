{"id":"ge-hch","title":"Dynamic Interactive Story Engine","description":"Build a Unity runtime narrative engine that enables rapid creation of immersive, story-first games, starting with an Ink-powered text-only MVP (M1) and evolving through AI-assisted branching toward a reactive simulated world.\n\n- **Problem**\n  - We need a Unity-based engine that makes it **fast and repeatable to create dynamic, immersive narrative games**, with a roadmap toward **AI-assisted** branching and world reactivity.\n  - The repository currently lacks a clear runtime-ready vertical slice (story runtime + player UX + save/load + runtime telemetry) that can be iterated in small focused loops.\n\n- **Users**\n  - **Players:** narrative-focused players (15–45 minute sessions) on desktop/mobile, with WebGL support.\n  - **Creators (internal initially):** Producer using AI assistance to generate initial Ink content for demos (future: writers/designers).\n\n- **Success criteria (M1 / MVP)**\n  - **Runtime story play:** Unity runtime loads and executes one Ink story end-to-end (branching choices at runtime) with no fatal runtime errors; demo story completes.\n  - **Player UX:** player can select choices; **single-slot save/load** works (autosave + manual save).\n  - **Performance:** first story screen cold start **≤ 8s** on desktop and **≤ 12s** on WebGL mobile (targets are measurable and can be tuned later if needed).\n  - **Observability:** **runtime** telemetry events emitted for story start, choice selected, and story completion (note: existing Ink Unity plugin supports this at design time; runtime support must be added).\n  - **Content:** at least **1 AI-generated demo story** is included and playable.\n\n- **Constraints**\n  - **Platform:** Unity targeting **desktop, mobile, and WebGL**.\n  - **Content source (M1):** AI creates demo Ink story content.\n  - **Timeline:** undefined / not fixed.\n  - **Telemetry:** must work **at runtime** (design-time-only telemetry is insufficient).\n  - **Ownership:** Producer (you) is owner/assignee for this epic.\n  - **Non-goals (M1):** none specified (explicitly).\n\n- **Existing state (if applicable)**\n  - No existing beads found that represent this engine epic; any current open bead(s) appear unrelated.\n  - No existing runtime Ink integration artifacts were found during high-level scanning (if they exist, Producer should point to the location).\n\n- **Desired change (if applicable)**\n  - Establish the initial “vertical slice” narrative runtime in Unity (Ink runtime + minimal UI + save/load + runtime telemetry) to enable rapid iteration, and provide a baseline to expand toward AI-assisted branching and, later, a simulated world.\n\n- **Milestones (suggested; editable)**\n  - **M0 (Scaffold / smoke demo):** Unity scene that can display static text panels and advance pages; basic UI layout works on desktop + WebGL.\n  - **M1 (MVP):** fully scripted, text-only interactive novel using Ink at runtime:\n    - branching choices, save/load (single slot), runtime telemetry, 1 playable demo story.\n  - **M1.5 (Content iteration loop):** workflow/tooling to rapidly swap stories + basic automated story regression replays (e.g., “golden path” replays).\n  - **M2:** scripted story with AI-generated branches:\n    - AI proposes branches within constraints; guardrails to prevent incoherent/unsafe output; runtime can integrate generated branches.\n  - **M3:** basic 2D backgrounds + 3D posed characters:\n    - story beats can trigger staging (background swap, character pose, simple animation cues).\n  - **M4:** simulated world reacting to player actions while following scripted arc:\n    - world state model + AI adaptation that preserves a high-level authorial arc; player agency feels real while narrative remains guided.\n  - **M5 (optional / advanced):** richer interaction + systemic characters:\n    - NPC goals/memory, quest/state graphs, and a narrative “director” steering toward story arcs.\n\n- **Related issues (Beads ids)**\n  - None identified as directly related.\n\n- **Recommended next step**\n  - PRD: `docs/prd/GDD_M1_dynamic_interactive_story_engine.md`\n\n- **Risks \u0026 assumptions (notes)**\n  - **Ink runtime integration risk:** plugin/runtime APIs may not support required runtime execution or will require custom glue code.\n  - **Telemetry gap:** design-time telemetry exists; runtime telemetry may need new plumbing and event schema decisions.\n  - **WebGL constraints:** memory/CPU budgets may force design constraints; early profiling may be needed.\n  - **AI-generated content quality/safety:** outputs may be incoherent or unsuitable; need guardrails and provenance/versioning later.\n  - **Save compatibility:** changes to story structure may break existing saves; define expectations early.","status":"in_progress","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","assignee":"rgardler","created_at":"2026-01-03T01:55:07.534717179-08:00","created_by":"rgardler","updated_at":"2026-01-03T17:07:23.139660938-08:00","labels":["PRD: Completed"]}
