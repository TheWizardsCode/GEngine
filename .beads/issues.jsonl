Keep a scheduled main run (nightly) and an optional gated run tied to GitHub Pages deploys for post-deploy validation.\\n\\nRationale:\\n- Reduce redundant costly CI runs on push-to-main while keeping safety via PR checks and periodic validation on main.\\n\\nImplementation plan (Ship):\\n1) Update .github/workflows/playwright.yml:\\n   - Remove or disable the 'push' trigger for main (or add a path filter) so it no longer runs on every push-to-main.\\n   - Ensure it runs on 'pull_request' and 'workflow_dispatch'.\\n   - Add a scheduled cron job entry (e.g., nightly) in the workflow or create a separate workflow that runs Playwright on main nightly.\\n   - Preserve artifact upload behavior on failure (no change needed unless altered).\\n2) Optionally add a small gated workflow to run Playwright after GitHub Pages deploy (or as part of the gh-pages workflow) if you want post-deploy validation.\\n3) Update docs: add a short note to docs/InkJS_README.md or docs/CI_RUNBOOK.md describing the Playwright policy and how to manually trigger runs.\\n\\nAcceptance criteria (Definition of Done):\\n- Playwright workflow triggers on PRs and no longer triggers on ordinary pushes to main.\\n- Nightly scheduled Playwright run exists and completes (or is configured) for main.\\n- Artifact upload on failure still occurs in PRs and scheduled runs.\\n- A bd comment on this bead documents the branch name used, PR URL (if created), or workflow run IDs demonstrating the new behavior.\\n\\nConstraints / Notes:\\n- Do NOT force-push or rewrite history on main.

This P0 task captures a manual test plan, acceptance criteria, and reporting instructions so QA (Probe) or the Producer can validate the feature across browsers and environments.\\n\\n## Acceptance criteria (Definition of Done)\\n- A tester can create a save at a non-terminal story point, refresh the page (or open in a new tab), and successfully load the save such that:\\n  - The story resumes at the exact same position (same passage/node).\\n  - UI state is restored (page text, available choices, and any visual flags e.g., smoke triggered).\\n  - Telemetry events for save/load (if present) are emitted or recorded (optional; note in results).\\n  - No fatal console errors or uncaught exceptions occur during save or load.\\n- Test recorded in the bead as a bd comment with: environment (browser + version), steps performed, pass/fail result, and any logs/screenshots/artifacts (attach via CI or reference file paths).\\n\\n## Test steps (manual)\\n1. Open the demo locally (recommended): \nadded 666 packages, and audited 667 packages in 7s\n\n168 packages are looking for funding\n  run `npm fund` for details\n\nfound 0 vulnerabilities and open http://localhost:3000/demo (or the documented URL). Alternatively open web/demo/index.html served over HTTP.\\n2. Start the stable demo story (web/stories/demo.ink).\\n3. Play to a decision point (choice list visible) or other non-terminal position. Record the current page text and available choices.\\n4. Trigger a manual Save (UI save button or developer console hook) — record timestamp and save payload if available (localStorage key or saved file).\\n5. Refresh the page (hard reload) and select Load (UI or dev hook).\\n6. Verify story resumes at the same position (page text matches recorded text, choices present).\\n7. Verify smoke visual state (if smoke had been triggered before save) restores correctly (smoke running or completed as appropriate).\\n8. Repeat under these variants:\\n   - Desktop Chromium (latest stable)\\n   - Desktop Firefox (latest stable)\\n   - Mobile emulation (Chromium)\\n   - Incognito/private window (if localStorage unsupported, note failure mode)\\n   - After clearing localStorage (verify save file download/load fallback if implemented)\\n9.

The smoke effect will be triggered by an Ink story cue in the demo (Ink-driven first pass).\n- File layout: place a minimal static demo under web/demo/ (index.html + js + assets). No full npm project required for the first pass; keep layout simple so demo can be opened in a browser.\n- Placeholder assets: acceptable. Use procedural/CSS/Canvas visuals or small PNGs where necessary.\n- Remote: no origin configured; all work will be implemented locally on branch feature/ge-hch.1.2.2-smoke and paused before any push.\n\nAcceptance criteria (testable)\n1) Demo loads in desktop and mobile browser viewports without fatal errors.\n2) InkJS story loads and runs; the story includes a cue that triggers the smoke visual (e.g., a tag or a specially-formatted line).\n3) Smoke visual appears when triggered and respects configurable parameters: duration (default 2–4s) and intensity.\n4) Demo supports single-slot save/load via localStorage preserving story position and whether smoke has been triggered.\n5) Telemetry hooks (console-visible) are present and called: story_start, smoke_triggered, story_complete.\n6) Dev run instructions included in docs/InkJS_README.md explaining how to open the demo locally and where the Ink story lives.\n\nMinimal implementation plan (high-level tasks)\n- web/demo/ skeleton + InkJS integration: load InkJS (forked), load web/stories/demo.ink, run story start and wire story events to demo hooks.  (priority: 1)\n- Smoke visual \u0026 trigger: implement smoke visual in JS/Canvas/CSS, and wire trigger to an Ink cue emitted by the story. (priority: 1, depends on skeleton)\n- Save/load: single-slot localStorage API to store story state (canonical story position + smoke state). (priority: 1, depends on skeleton)\n- Docs: docs/InkJS_README.md updated with run instructions, telemetry hook examples, and demo file list. (priority: 2)\n\nDeliverables (planned files)\n- web/demo/index.html\n- web/demo/js/inkrunner.js (small wrapper to load InkJS and story)\n- web/demo/js/smoke.js\n- web/stories/demo.ink\n- web/demo/assets/* (small placeholders)\n- docs/InkJS_README.md (update or create)\n\nOpen operational notes\n- Keep all changes local until a remote is provided.

The new test must *not* intercept so it exercises the repo’s demo.ink.\n\n3) Story validation tool \u0026 CI enforcement (ge-hch.3.4) — Required: scripts/validate-story.js that parses .ink with InkJS and performs a minimal runtime smoke; CI should run it against web/stories/*.ink before E2E tests.\n   - Status: OPEN (blocking for robust CI enforcement)\n   - Acceptance: scripts/validate-story.js exists and CI runs it against web/stories/*.ink; exits non-zero on parse/runtime failure.\n\nFiles inspected during this review (read-only):\n- web/stories/demo.ink\n- web/stories/test.ink\n- web/demo/index.html\n- web/demo/js/inkrunner.js\n- web/demo/js/smoke.js\n- web/demo/js/telemetry.js\n- web/demo/vendor/ink.js\n- docs/InkJS_README.md\n- package.json\n- .github/workflows/playwright.yml\n- tests/demo.telemetry.spec.ts\n- tests/demo.smoke.spec.ts\n- config/waif_pacakges.yaml\n\nCommands executed during inspection (audit):\n- bd show ge-hch.3.2 --json\n- bd show ge-hch.3.2.1 --json\n- bd show ge-hch.3.2.2 --json\n- glob web/stories/**/*.ink\n- read web/stories/demo.ink\n- read web/demo/js/inkrunner.js\n- read web/demo/js/smoke.js\n- read docs/InkJS_README.md\n- read .github/workflows/playwright.yml\n- read package.json\n- read tests/demo.telemetry.spec.ts\n\nFiles created/edited/deleted while working this issue in this session: none\n\nVerification commands for implementers:\n- npm run test:demo    # serves web/ and runs Playwright E2E\n- npx playwright test tests/demo.stable.spec.ts --config=playwright.config.ts  # run the stable demo spec only\n- npm run test:unit\n\nRisks and notes:\n- CI currently does not parse/validate .ink files; without ge-hch.3.4 a swapped/generated story could break runtime and only be caught during E2E or post-merge.\n- Existing Playwright tests route/replace demo.ink for deterministic assertions; that masks whether the bundled demo.ink itself is valid under InkJS in CI.

Verify artifacts\n   - Confirm artifacts with names/paths similar to `replay-artifacts-\u003crun_id\u003e` or `playwright-report-\u003crun_id\u003e` are present.\n   - List artifact names, sizes, and retention-days configured.\n   - Download one representative artifact (e.g., playwright-report/index.html or replay log) and verify it opens locally.\n4. If failures\n   - For failed runs, list the artifact paths and specific files (e.g., test-results/replay/session-\u003cid\u003e.json, trace.zip, screenshot-*.png).\n5. Report\n   - Add a bd comment to the parent bead `ge-hch.4.4` with: run URLs, run IDs, artifact names and short outcome note (pass/fail + artifacts present).\n   - Add a bd comment to this bead (`ge-hch.4.4.3`) with the same details and any recommendations (e.g., retention-days change, ensure upload uses `if: always()`).\n6.

Prompts should include explicit guardrails (max length, allowed tags, prohibited content).\n- Optional seed: numeric seed for deterministic generation.\n- Config: temperature (default 0.6), max_tokens, model endpoint (OpenAI-compatible URL), provenance fields (author, branch).\n\nOutput contract\n- Primary artifact: web/stories/generated/\u003cslug\u003e.ink (Ink file). Requirements:\n  - Must begin with a metadata header (Ink comment lines or special tag) containing: title, author, version, seed.\n  - Include telemetry tags at logical points: e.g., // @telemetry:story_start, // @telemetry:choice_selected, // @telemetry:smoke_trigger\n  - Use clear choice markers so InkJS renders choices normally.\n- Companion manifest JSON: web/stories/generated/\u003cslug\u003e.json with schema:\n  - { title: string, author: string, prompt: string, seed: number, version: string, safe_rating: string }\n\nValidation steps (agent harness)\n1) Parse run: use InkJS parser/load to ensure no parse errors.\n2) Runtime smoke: load the story in a minimal runner to ensure it reaches first choice and that telemetry tags exist.\n3) Golden-path test: the generated story should complete in a scripted run or at least reach a defined end-state without exceptions (optional for first pass).\n\nDeterminism \u0026 seeding\n- Agent must support deterministic mode: given the same prompt + seed + model config, output should be repeatable.\n- The seed value is recorded in manifest.\n\nSafety and guardrails\n- Output must be post-processed to remove content violating safety constraints. Agent must include a sanitization pass and a safety rating in manifest.\n\nExample prompt templates\n- Short template (recommended default):\n  Write a short interactive Ink story (~200-400 words) suitable for browser play. Include branching choices (2-3 choices) and insert telemetry markers: // @telemetry:story_start at the start, // @telemetry:choice_selected before each choice, and // @telemetry:smoke_trigger as a tag on a single passage. Output only a single .ink file content.\n\n- Long template (detailed):\n  You are an Ink author. Create a 5-8 node interactive story suitable for a 10-15 minute play session. Include: a title, 2-3 branching choices per decision point, an explicit passage marked with // @telemetry:smoke_trigger (include duration=3s and intensity=medium as a comment), and ensure all choices are labeled for machine parsing. Keep language safe for ages 13+. Return only the Ink source and ensure it compiles.\n\nTesting expectations\n- Unit tests validate manifest schema and presence of telemetry tags.\n- E2E tests run validate-story then run the replay harness if provided.\n\nAgent run CLI\n- scripts/generate_story.js --template short|long --seed 1234 --out web/stories/generated\n\nOpen questions\n- Model selection: default to OpenAI-compatible endpoint with online auth. Confirm model families allowed.\n\n","created_at":"2026-01-08T03:53:03Z"}]}
