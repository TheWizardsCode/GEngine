Jeffrey Emanuel’s process shows that real convergence typically happens on the 4th or 5th pass, so enforce 4–5 focused reviews (mixing narrow and broad perspectives) after every major task—design, planning, implementation, and architecture. Expect later reviews to surface issues missed earlier, and don’t hesitate to push for that awkward third, fourth, or fifth review; it’s the first point you can moderately trust the output.\n\nAsk agents to perform both small-scale and big-picture inspections: start with standard code reviews, then escalate to existential and architectural questions. Encourage creativity so the agent hunts for code smells, redundant systems, low coverage, over-engineering, and whether you’re building the right thing at all.\n\nAutomate the Rule of Five wherever possible so each workstream gets:\n- 5 passes over the design\n- 5 passes over the Beads implementation plan (for better issues, dependencies, and execution)\n- 5 passes over the implementation (generation + 4 reviews)\n- 5 passes over the tests\n- 5 passes focused on code health and refactoring hygiene\n\nUse prompting to drive this initially, but plan to script it because every nontrivial effort should receive these cycles. Demand at least 2–3 passes on small tasks and 4–5 on larger or unfamiliar work; err on the side of more reviews if the stack or domain is new. Yes, it’s slower and more expensive upfront, but skipping it leads to invisible debt, rework, and sluggish agents.

{"id":"GEngine-p6j.6","title":"Prioritize code health","description":"Create workflow steps to implement the process described below.\n\nSpend 40% of your time on code health, or else you’ll wind up spending \u003e60%.\n\nGene was curious how I could be so confident in Beads if I’ve never looked at the code. My answer to him was one of the easiest I’ve ever given. If you are vibe coding, i.e., having the AI write all your code for you, then you need to spent at least 30–40% of your time, queries, and money on code health. That’s how you make sure your code is OK. You have the AI conduct regular code inspections. Tons of them.\n\nIt’s pretty easy in principle: Every now and then, you pause your regular work, and tell your agents: go find code smells of all shapes and sizes. Have them file Beads for anything that needs followup. Tell the agent to look for large files that need refactoring, areas with low test coverage, duplicated/redundant systems, legacy code, dead code, poorly-documented code, etc. etc. etc. I don’t have a good prompt for this step yet; would appreciate it if anyone has crafted one. But you can also just ask your agent to help craft it.\n\nYou’ll also want to ask your agent to do cleanups during the code-health passes. Have it look for files that are in the wrong place, or have misleading names, or need better homes. Have it clean up debug cruft, ancient plans, build artifacts, old docs, anything you don’t need. This is all part of the regular hygiene and maintenance of a vibe-coded code base.\n\nIt helps to be creative, and also to ask the agent to be creative, thinking outside the box. After the first round or two of regular code reviews, start having it look for over-engineered subsystems (YAGNI), opportunities where your code could have used a third-party library, and other broad, system-level concerns.\n\nBasically the agent will always find problems, often shocking ones, e.g. where you discover you have two or even three completely redundant systems (databases, logging, telemetry, whatever) that need consolidating. And since agents tend to accrete code without automatic refactoring, your vibe-coded source files will tend to grow to thousands of lines, which makes them harder to agents (and humans) to reason about. So you should tell it regularly to break things up, and then run dedicated sessions to implement the refactoring!\n\nDuring each code review, have your agent file Beads for everything it discovers. Then have it review the epics and issues (up to 5 times; see below) to ensure the implementation will go smoothly.\n\nThen swarm to fix it all! Do all this at least weekly. For me, I’d estimate I spend about 25–30% of my time and money on code health, and I don’t think it’s enough. As long as I continue to find serious problems with reviews, I need to do more reviews. My current guidance is that you should expect nearly half of your work to be code-health related.\n\nWhat happens if you don’t follow this rule? You gradually (but rapidly) accumulate invisible technical debt that weighs down your agents in various ways — too much code, conflicting code, obsolete docs, etc. Your agents will begin to work more slowly and you’ll see more bugs in their outputs.\n\nStay on top of code health, and you’ll keep your vibe-coded code base sprightly.\n\nCreated: 2025-12-18T05:30:29.160Z","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-17T21:30:41.447688716-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-17T23:17:28.666649498-08:00","labels":["milestone:quality-automation"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"GEngine-p6j.6","depends_on_id":"GEngine-p6j","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-17T21:30:41.469270056-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
