The smoke effect will be triggered by an Ink story cue in the demo (Ink-driven first pass).\n- File layout: place a minimal static demo under web/demo/ (index.html + js + assets). No full npm project required for the first pass; keep layout simple so demo can be opened in a browser.\n- Placeholder assets: acceptable. Use procedural/CSS/Canvas visuals or small PNGs where necessary.\n- Remote: no origin configured; all work will be implemented locally on branch feature/ge-hch.1.2.2-smoke and paused before any push.\n\nAcceptance criteria (testable)\n1) Demo loads in desktop and mobile browser viewports without fatal errors.\n2) InkJS story loads and runs; the story includes a cue that triggers the smoke visual (e.g., a tag or a specially-formatted line).\n3) Smoke visual appears when triggered and respects configurable parameters: duration (default 2–4s) and intensity.\n4) Demo supports single-slot save/load via localStorage preserving story position and whether smoke has been triggered.\n5) Telemetry hooks (console-visible) are present and called: story_start, smoke_triggered, story_complete.\n6) Dev run instructions included in docs/InkJS_README.md explaining how to open the demo locally and where the Ink story lives.\n\nMinimal implementation plan (high-level tasks)\n- web/demo/ skeleton + InkJS integration: load InkJS (forked), load web/stories/demo.ink, run story start and wire story events to demo hooks.  (priority: 1)\n- Smoke visual \u0026 trigger: implement smoke visual in JS/Canvas/CSS, and wire trigger to an Ink cue emitted by the story. (priority: 1, depends on skeleton)\n- Save/load: single-slot localStorage API to store story state (canonical story position + smoke state). (priority: 1, depends on skeleton)\n- Docs: docs/InkJS_README.md updated with run instructions, telemetry hook examples, and demo file list. (priority: 2)\n\nDeliverables (planned files)\n- web/demo/index.html\n- web/demo/js/inkrunner.js (small wrapper to load InkJS and story)\n- web/demo/js/smoke.js\n- web/stories/demo.ink\n- web/demo/assets/* (small placeholders)\n- docs/InkJS_README.md (update or create)\n\nOpen operational notes\n- Keep all changes local until a remote is provided. I will not push or create a PR until you give a remote/permission.\n- Implementation should be executed by the implementation agent per the plan above; Map will coordinate and create follow-ups as required.\n\nNext step\n- Create implementation subtasks and hand off to an implementation owner to implement and validate.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-03T20:44:44.573309977-08:00","updated_at":"2026-01-06T02:45:19.2865077-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-06T02:45:19.28651254-08:00","created_by":"rgardler","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"ge-hch.1.2.2","depends_on_id":"ge-hch.1.2","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-03T20:44:44.574526842-08:00","created_by":"rgardler"}]}
