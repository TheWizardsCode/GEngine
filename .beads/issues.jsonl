In practice, full `bd sync` performs git operations (commit/pull/push) and can fail when no remote is configured.\n- Recommend changing Step 5 to: run `bd sync --flush-only` before commits (or rely on the pre-commit hook), and reserve full `bd sync` for end-of-session / multi-device sync.\n- Optional: mention `bd sync --no-pull --no-push` for “local-only” situations.\n\n2) Make remote requirements explicit (both docs)\n- docs/dev/workflow.md assumes `origin` exists (`git push -u origin ...`), but the repo can be in a state with no remotes configured.\n- Recommend adding a short pre-step: “Verify remote exists: `git remote -v`”, and if missing, set it from `$REPO_URL`.\n- Add env var `REMOTE_NAME=\"origin\"` (or adjust commands to use `$REMOTE_NAME`).\n\n3) Standardize on BD_ACTOR vs AGENT_NAME\n- docs/dev/workflow.md defines `AGENT_NAME` but bd’s audit identity is `$BD_ACTOR` / `--actor`.\n- Recommend replacing/augmenting `AGENT_NAME` with `BD_ACTOR` in workflow.md’s environment section (and optionally referencing it in AGENTS.md quick reference).\n\n4) Tighten “executable doc” consistency\n- The workflow doc structure is good (Intro/Prereqs/Env/Steps/Summary/Next Steps). A few small tweaks would make it more “executable”:\n  - The env var descriptions say “append _${HASH}” but the defaults already include _${HASH} (WORKTREE_ROOT, BRANCH_NAME). Recommend rewording to avoid confusion.\n  - Consider adding `BASE_BRANCH=\"master\"` (or main) to avoid implicit base-branch assumptions.\n\n5) Reduce duplication + cross-link\n- AGENTS.md contains a “Landing the plane” block that mandates `git pull --rebase; bd sync; git push`.\n- Recommend cross-linking to docs/dev/workflow.md and adjusting the “push is mandatory” language to be conditional: “if a remote is configured”. Otherwise specify what “done” means for a local-only repo (commit locally; add remote later).\n\n6) Minor edits (low priority)\n- AGENTS.md typos: “informaiton”, “chosen own” → “chosen owner”.\n\nIf you want, I can turn these into concrete doc edits in a PR once the desired default remote/base-branch is confirmed.\n","created_at":"2025-12-17T11:11:20Z"},{"id":2,"issue_id":"GEngine-p4p.2","author":"rgardler","text":"Implemented the recommendations in docs: updated docs/dev/workflow.md to use BD_ACTOR/REMOTE_NAME/BASE_BRANCH, added explicit remote verification, and switched per-commit guidance to bd sync --flush-only; updated AGENTS.md to make push-to-remote conditional on a configured remote and fixed typos.
