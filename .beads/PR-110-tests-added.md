Added PR https://github.com/TheWizardsCode/GEngine/pull/117 with validate-story integration tests and fixtures (cherry-picked from feature/ge-hch.3.4.6-tests). Adjusted tests to use --state-file and tolerate extra fields in result objects.

Files changed:
- tests/validate-story/validate-story.integration.test.js
- tests/validate-story/validate-story.test.js
- tests/validate-story/rotation-state.test.js
- tests/fixtures/validate-story/*

Note: No runtime code changed (scripts/validate-story.js unchanged).
