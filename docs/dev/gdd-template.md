# Game Design Document (GDD) Template

## Introduction
This template is designed for an AI-driven game development team with two human roles: `Producer` and `Prompt Engineer`, and multiple AI agents (e.g., `Muse`, `Map`, `Patch`, `Pixel`, `Probe`, `Scribbler`, `Ship`).

It is written to be filled in collaboratively:
- The **Producer** is accountable for product decisions and final sign-off.
- The **Prompt Engineer** ensures prompts/templates are precise, repeatable, and auditable.
- AI agents **draft**, **iterate**, and **propose**; the Producer approves.

Use this as a living document: update it when the design changes, and link changes to the relevant `bd` issues/PRs.

---

## How to use this template
- **Fill the “Decisions” fields first**, then let AI agents propose options for everything else.
- Keep sections short and testable. Prefer measurable statements over prose.
- For every important change, add:
  - a `bd` comment summarizing the decision
  - the PR URL (if applicable)

**AI Delegation guidance**
- `Map` (Product Manager): creates/maintains an implementation plan (tracking issues + dependency graph).
- `Muse` (Designer): proposes mechanics, loops, balance, and variants.
- `Patch` (Implementation): prototypes systems and integration.
- `Pixel` (Art): proposes style + assets.
- `Probe` (QA): automated tests + telemetry/regression summaries.
- `Scribbler` (Docs): keeps this GDD and related docs aligned.
- `Ship` (DevOps): CI/build/release pipeline.
