[2025-11-28 14:45 UTC] Planned M3.4 scope: config-driven safeguards (CLI run/script caps, service tick limits), LOD tuning, and profiling hooks per implementation plan.
[2025-11-28 14:47 UTC] Decided to add content/config/simulation.yml plus SimulationConfig loader, wire guards into SimEngine, CLI, and service, then update docs/tests accordingly.
[2025-11-28 15:10 UTC] Planned validation pass: extend CLI/service/engine tests for new safeguards, refresh docs (README, gameplay guide, plan, GDD), and rerun pytest with coverage.
[2025-11-28 15:32 UTC] Planning M3.5 headless driver: add scripts/run_headless_sim.py with chunked tick loops, JSON summary output, CLI args for world/ticks/lod, plus docs/tests updates.
[2025-11-28 15:55 UTC] Implemented headless driver, new tests, and documentation updates; ready to merge M3.5 deliverable.
[2025-11-28 16:05 UTC] Planning Phase 4 scope: break down agent AI, faction AI, economy, environment work into actionable milestones with dependencies, test strategy, and data updates before implementation.
[2025-11-28 16:08 UTC] Began M4.1 Agent AI work on branch feature/m4-1-agent-ai; plan to extend agent schema, add systems/agents subsystem, telemetry, and regression tests.
[2025-11-28 16:22 UTC] Investigating reported issues in AgentSystem (HEAD 7ff64328) to unblock M4.1 and ensure telemetry/tests stay accurate.
[2025-11-28 16:30 UTC] Running full pytest suite on feature/m4-1-agent-ai (HEAD 7ff64328) and capturing telemetry for QA records once green.
[2025-11-28 16:37 UTC] Pytest sweep passed (39 tests). Captured balanced LOD telemetry via run_headless_sim (ticks=200, seed=42) to build/m4-1-agent-telemetry.json for regression tracking.
[2025-11-28 16:42 UTC] Documenting telemetry workflow (README, implementation plan, gamedev agent instructions) so every regression run captures canonical headless metrics.
[2025-11-28 16:48 UTC] Preparing to merge feature/m4-1-agent-ai into main (HEAD 7ff64328) and spin up new branch for M4.2 per workflow instructions.
[2025-11-28 16:52 UTC] Re-ran full pytest suite (39 green) post-doc updates; staging telemetry + M4.1 assets for merge.
[2025-11-28 16:55 UTC] Fast-forwarded main with feature/m4-1-agent-ai (commit e0e3ea4) after confirming clean status; readying for Phase 4 follow-on work.
[2025-11-28 16:56 UTC] Created branch feature/m4-2-faction-ai to begin the faction AI milestone per the implementation plan.
[2025-11-28 17:02 UTC] Reviewing GDD/plan to break down M4.2 (faction AI) tasks before touching code; goal is scripted legitimacy/resource delta modeling plus events.
[2025-11-28 17:06 UTC] Started implementing FactionSystem (cooldowns, strategic actions, telemetry plumbing) and updating docs/tests to reflect faction beats.
[2025-11-28 17:20 UTC] Added factions subsystem, tick wiring, telemetry outputs, and scenario tests; ran targeted pytest suites plus full run (41 green) before telemetry capture.
[2025-11-28 17:23 UTC] Captured balanced telemetry with faction metrics via run_headless_sim (seed=42, ticks=200) to build/m4-2-faction-telemetry.json per updated workflow.
[2025-11-28 17:28 UTC] Merged feature/m4-2-faction-ai (commit 2e7d47b) into main; ready to pick up next Phase 4 milestone tasks 1 & 2 requested by PM.
