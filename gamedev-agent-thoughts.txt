851bb25: Ran cushioned sweep telemetry (200 ticks, balanced LOD) to verify story-seed cooldown metadata persists under low-scarcity pressure; capture written to build/feature-m4-7-story-seeds-cushioned.json with energy quota + hollow supply chain seeds holding cooldown_remaining values.
851bb25: Ran high-pressure sweep telemetry (200 ticks, balanced LOD) to stress scarcity and confirm cooldown metadata survives heavy suppression; capture written to build/feature-m4-7-story-seeds-high-pressure.json showing both seeds active with updated reasons (pollution breach + cartel investment) and elevated scores.
851bb25: Verified repo state before Phase 4 deepening—worktree heavily modified/untracked, no git remotes configured, and feature/m4-7-story-seeds is at parity with main (no commits to merge), so we need instructions on handling the local changes before proceeding.
851bb25: Ran uv run --group dev pytest (92 passed, 0 failed) to validate the story-seed cooldown work before committing.
851bb25: Captured canonical telemetry via uv run python scripts/run_headless_sim.py --world default --ticks 200 --lod balanced --seed 42 --output build/feature-m4-7-story-seeds.json (cooldown metadata intact; 359 suppressed events, tick_ms_p95 0.42ms).

727e630: Fast-forwarded main to include feature/m4-7-story-seeds and branched feature/m4-8-phase4-deepening for the upcoming environment + telemetry refinements.

[2025-11-28 12:10 UTC] Preparing to merge feature/m3-4-prep into main and then implement the follow-up recommendations (CLI summary verification + profiling history sweep config) requested by the PM.
[2025-11-28 12:12 UTC] HEAD 346efe2 (main): Merged feature/m3-4-prep into main so the profiling/guardrail refresh and telemetry artifact are now baseline; next up is executing the two follow-on recommendations.

[2025-11-28 13:03 UTC] HEAD=c7b206fca89f5f09a5ecb3fe3d0c47adcc4e0b9d Ran `uv run python scripts/run_headless_sim.py --world default --ticks 1000 --lod balanced --seed 42 --config-root content/config/sweeps/profiling-history --output build/profiling-history-1000tick.json` (stability fell to 0.0 by tick 400, anomalies=989 driven by event_budget caps, tick_ms p95=0.22ms).
[2025-11-28 13:06 UTC] HEAD=c7b206fca89f5f09a5ecb3fe3d0c47adcc4e0b9d Planning mitigation experiments: (A) higher event budget via new profiling-history-high-budget config, (B) softer scarcity via profiling-history-soft-scarcity config; run 1000-tick soaks for each to guide M4.6 tuning.
[2025-11-28 13:08 UTC] HEAD=c7b206fca89f5f09a5ecb3fe3d0c47adcc4e0b9d Ran `uv run --group dev pytest --cov=gengine --cov-report=term-missing` (70 passed, 96% coverage) before long-run anomaly experiments.
[2025-11-28 13:18 UTC] HEAD=c7b206f Ran 1000-tick soak with profiling-history-high-budget config (`max_events_per_tick=12`): anomalies dropped to 759 but stability still collapsed after tick 400; telemetry saved to build/profiling-history-high-budget-1000tick.json for comparison against other mitigation runs.
[2025-11-28 13:25 UTC] HEAD=c7b206f Ran 1000-tick soak with profiling-history-soft-scarcity config (lower scarcity pressure/weights): anomalies remained high at 977 with stability crashing after tick 600; results captured in build/profiling-history-soft-scarcity-1000tick.json.
[2025-11-28 13:28 UTC] HEAD=c7b206f Re-ran regression suite post-config tweaks (`uv run --group dev pytest --cov=gengine --cov-report=term-missing`); 70 tests passed, 96% coverage maintained.
[2025-11-28 13:32 UTC] HEAD=c7b206f Created feature/m4-5-anomaly-mitigation branch to continue anomaly budget experiments without polluting main.
[2025-11-28 13:34 UTC] HEAD=c7b206f Plan: iterate both mitigation tracks—(1) raise `lod.max_events_per_tick` plus volatility tweaks in the high-budget profile, (2) further soften scarcity weights/caps/demand in the soft-scarcity profile—and run 1000-tick soaks until anomaly counts fall below 100 while monitoring stability curves.
[2025-11-28 13:38 UTC] HEAD=c7b206f High-budget pass (`max_events_per_tick=20`) yielded only 3 event-budget anomalies but still crashed stability after tick ~350; telemetry refreshed at build/profiling-history-high-budget-1000tick.json.
[2025-11-28 13:44 UTC] HEAD=c7b206f Soft-scarcity pass (regen_scale 1.4, lowered weights, capped pressure=2) kept stability at 1.0 but only reduced event-budget anomalies to 225; telemetry stored in build/profiling-history-soft-scarcity-1000tick.json.
[2025-11-28 13:49 UTC] HEAD=c7b206f Further soft-scarcity damping (volatility down to 0.12/0.08, regen_scale 1.6, scarcity threshold 3.0) plateaued around 227 anomalies—resource drift + agent summaries still spike past the 6-event budget.
[2025-11-28 13:52 UTC] HEAD=c7b206f Temporarily raised the soft-scarcity cap to 30 to measure raw event volume (~5 events/tick, 0 anomalies) confirming that >6 events happen sporadically, not every tick.
[2025-11-28 13:55 UTC] HEAD=c7b206f Restored the 6-event cap and reran the tuned soft-scarcity sweep to keep telemetry aligned with the intended config despite the still-elevated 227 anomaly count.
[2025-11-28 13:58 UTC] HEAD=c7b206f Regression suite re-run after config/doc edits (`uv run --group dev pytest --cov=gengine --cov-report=term-missing`); 70 green, 96% coverage maintained.

727e630: Ran profiling-history sweep (`--config-root content/config/sweeps/profiling-history --output build/feature-m4-8-phase4-deepening-profiling-history.json`): stability held at 1.0, unrest settled near 0.006, pollution ≈0.36, tick_ms_p95 ≈0.38ms, suppressed_events 290, 0 anomalies.
727e630: Planning plotting step—add a telemetry comparison script that loads the three sweep JSONs and charts pollution/unrest trajectories via matplotlib so designers can visualize diffusion clamp behavior.
727e630: Implementing the plotting utility next—plan is to parse director_history timelines from each sweep JSON, render pollution/unrest overlays via matplotlib, update the README with usage instructions, and run pytest afterward.
727e630: Added scripts/plot_environment_trajectories.py plus README guidance; the utility loads director_history samples from the cushioned/high-pressure/profiling-history telemetry captures, plots pollution/unrest overlays, supports custom --run inputs, and can save figures via --output.
727e630: Added matplotlib to the dev dependency set and ran `uv sync --group dev` so the plotting utility installs cleanly inside the project venv.
727e630: Ran `uv run --group dev pytest` after the dependency refresh—93 tests passed, confirming the new tooling did not upset existing coverage.
727e630: Smoke-tested the plotting workflow via `uv run python scripts/plot_environment_trajectories.py --output build/phase4-deepening-trajectories.png`, producing the comparison figure for review.
727e630: Updated README, GDD, implementation plan, and gameplay guide with the new telemetry plotting workflow so designers have consistent instructions across surfaces.
727e630: Added adjacency-biased diffusion clamps plus telemetry surfacing—EnvironmentSettings/EnvironmentSystem now support neighbor bias + min/max deltas, CLI summary prints averages/extremes/sample deltas, configs expose the knobs, and tests cover the new reporting.
727e630: Re-ran `uv run --group dev pytest` (93 passed) after the diffusion telemetry updates to keep the validation log complete.
