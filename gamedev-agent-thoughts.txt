<<<<<<< HEAD
## [tracker_agent] — 2025-12-07 04:04
- Created and documented task 12.1.1 (Terminal UI Core Implementation) in .pm/tracker.md. Updated summary table and milestone details. Lint check run; only line length warnings present.

## [Game Design Agent] — 2025-12-07 04:41
- Ran batch simulations for balanced, aggressive, and diplomatic strategies. All reached stable outcomes with no grind or dead-ends. Updated GDD with results and next steps for deeper tension testing.

## [Game Design Agent] — 2025-12-07 04:53
- Recommended adding disruptive story seeds and resource scarcity to increase tension and outcome variation. Updated GDD with proposal and balance guidance. Next: prototype new events and configs, then validate via batch sweeps.

## [Game Design Agent] — 2025-12-07 04:54
- Updated GDD with detailed design for disruptive story seeds and resource scarcity. Documented mechanics, tuning knobs, game loop impact, balance guidance, and enjoyment risks. Ready for prototyping and playtest validation.

## [GameDev Agent] — 2025-12-07 04:59
- Implemented disruptive story seed (Supply Chain Collapse) and increased resource scarcity in default world config. Updated GDD and implementation plan with changes. Next: Validate impact via batch simulation sweeps and telemetry review.

## [GameDev Agent] — 2025-12-07 05:02
- Followed agent instructions and README setup. Attempted batch sweeps after dependency install; encountered 'No module named gengine' error. Next: Review runner script and PYTHONPATH, ensure src/gengine is discoverable, then rerun sweeps. Ready for test_agent handoff after successful run.

## [GitHub Copilot] — 2025-12-06 14:50
- Fixed YAML validation errors in `content/worlds/default/world.yml` (missing `goals` list for `dr-lyra-keel`).
- Updated tests to reflect content changes:
  - `tests/echoes/test_content_loader.py`: Updated expected counts for factions (3) and agents (4).
  - `tests/echoes/test_story_seeds.py`: Updated expected followup seed ID.
  - `tests/echoes/test_faction_system.py`: Isolated faction test state to prevent interference from the newly added `hollow_perimeter` faction.
- Verified all tests pass with `uv run pytest -v`.
- Note: Test coverage is at 87.46% (below 90% target), but all tests are passing.

## [GitHub Copilot] — 2025-12-06 15:00
- Refactored `tests/echoes/test_content_loader.py` to prevent future brittleness:
  - Added `test_load_world_bundle_custom_content`: A new test using a temporary fixture to verify loader logic with controlled, minimal content.
  - Updated `test_load_world_bundle_default_world`: Changed exact count assertions (==) to minimum count assertions (>=). This ensures the test verifies the default world is loaded and populated without breaking when new content is added.
- Verified all tests pass with `uv run pytest tests/echoes/test_content_loader.py`.

## [GitHub Copilot] — 2025-12-06 21:55
- Improved test coverage for `src/gengine/balance_studio` package to >90%.
- Created `tests/balance_studio/test_cli.py` (100% coverage).
- Created `tests/balance_studio/test_workflows.py` (90% coverage).
- Created `tests/balance_studio/test_overlays.py` (97% coverage).
