# CI Balance Sweeps Configuration
# Reduced parameter grid for fast CI validation of balance changes.
# This configuration is optimized for speed while still providing meaningful coverage.

# Parameter Grid - reduced from full sweeps for CI speed
parameters:
  # Three representative strategies covering the spectrum
  strategies:
    - balanced
    - aggressive
    - diplomatic

  # Three difficulty presets to validate scaling
  difficulties:
    - easy
    - normal
    - hard

  # Five deterministic seeds for reproducibility with statistical significance
  seeds:
    - 42
    - 123
    - 456
    - 789
    - 1000

  # Default world only for CI (additional worlds tested in nightly full sweeps)
  worlds:
    - default

  # Reduced tick budget for faster execution (100 ticks captures most dynamics)
  tick_budgets:
    - 100

# Parallel execution settings optimized for CI runners
parallel:
  # Use 2 workers to balance speed and resource usage on CI
  max_workers: 2

  # Shorter timeout for CI
  timeout_per_sweep: 120

# Output configuration
output:
  # Standard CI output directory
  dir: build/ci_sweeps

  # Include telemetry for debugging but keep it minimal
  include_telemetry: true

  # Include summary for report generation
  include_summary: true

# Sampling - use full grid since CI grid is already small (3*3*5*1*1 = 45 combinations)
sampling:
  mode: full
  sample_count: 45
  sample_seed: 42

# Metadata for traceability
metadata:
  include_git_commit: true
  include_timestamp: true
  include_runtime_info: true
