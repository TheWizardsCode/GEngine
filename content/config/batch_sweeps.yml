# Batch Simulation Sweep Configuration
# Defines parameter ranges for multi-dimensional simulation sweeps.
# Used by scripts/run_batch_sweeps.py for balance analysis and regression testing.

# Parameter Grid - each combination is tested (Cartesian product)
parameters:
  # AI strategies to test
  strategies:
    - balanced
    - aggressive
    - diplomatic

  # Difficulty presets (maps to content/config/sweeps/difficulty-<preset>/)
  difficulties:
    - normal

  # Random seeds for deterministic reproducibility
  # Can be explicit list or range definition
  seeds:
    - 42
    - 123
    - 456

  # World bundles to test (from content/worlds/)
  worlds:
    - default

  # Tick budgets for simulation length
  tick_budgets:
    - 100

# Parallel execution settings
parallel:
  # Maximum worker processes (null = auto-detect based on CPU count)
  max_workers: null

  # Timeout per individual sweep in seconds
  timeout_per_sweep: 300

# Output configuration
output:
  # Directory for sweep result JSON files
  dir: build/batch_sweeps

  # Include full telemetry in output (increases file size)
  include_telemetry: true

  # Include game state summary in output
  include_summary: true

# Sampling configuration for large parameter spaces
# When enabled, samples from the grid instead of full Cartesian product
sampling:
  # Sampling mode: "full" (all combinations), "random", "latin_hypercube"
  mode: full

  # Number of samples to take (only used when mode != "full")
  sample_count: 100

  # Random seed for sampling reproducibility
  sample_seed: 42

# Metadata included in every sweep output
metadata:
  # Include git commit hash if available
  include_git_commit: true

  # Include timestamp
  include_timestamp: true

  # Include runtime environment info
  include_runtime_info: true
