# Example Tuning Overlay for Echoes of Emergence
# ================================================
#
# This file demonstrates how to create configuration overlays for balance testing.
# Overlays merge with the base simulation.yml, allowing you to test parameter
# changes without modifying the base configuration.
#
# Usage:
#   echoes-balance-studio test-tuning --overlay content/config/overlays/example_tuning.yml
#
# Structure:
#   Only include the settings you want to change. Missing settings will use
#   base configuration values. Nested sections are deep-merged.

# Metadata (optional) - helps document what this overlay is testing

  hypothesis: "Increasing regen_scale should improve stability without making the game too easy"

# Economy adjustments
# Hypothesis: Slightly faster resource regeneration helps new players
# without trivializing resource management
economy:
  # Increase base regeneration by 25% (0.8 -> 1.0)
  regen_scale: 1.0
  # Slightly reduce the threshold for shortages to trigger earlier warnings
  shortage_threshold: 0.25
  # Allow prices to fluctuate more for interesting market dynamics
  price_max_boost: 0.6

# Environment adjustments
# Hypothesis: Softer scarcity pressure gives players more recovery time
environment:
  # Reduce how much scarcity affects unrest
  scarcity_unrest_weight: 0.00003
  # Allow biodiversity to recover faster
  biodiversity_recovery_rate: 0.05

# Director adjustments (optional)
# Hypothesis: Longer quiet periods between story seeds reduces overwhelm
# director:
#   global_quiet_ticks: 6
#   seed_quiet_ticks: 8
