# Example Overlay: Aggressive Economy
# Demonstrates how to use YAML overlays to test balance changes.
#
# This overlay increases resource regeneration and reduces scarcity pressure
# to test how the game behaves with a more forgiving economy.
#
# Usage:
#   echoes-balance-studio sweep --overlay content/config/overlays/aggressive_economy.yml
#
# Or use test-tuning for quick experiments:
#   echoes-balance-studio test-tuning --name aggressive_econ \
#       --change economy.regen_scale=1.2 \
#       --change environment.scarcity_pressure_cap=4000

  Test higher resource regeneration and reduced scarcity.
  Use this overlay to see how the game behaves when resources
  are more abundant and scarcity pressure is lower.

overrides:
  economy:
    regen_scale: 1.2
