Safety gate: handle dirty working tree\n\n   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).\n   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-64m`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-64m --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-64m-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-64m-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-64m --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-64m --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file. Including a link to the PR. Provide hints on how to test any new functionality locally. Ask the user to review the PR and merge when ready.\n   - Ask the producer to provide feedback on the implementation and, if ready to do so, to instruct the agent to \"land the plane\" (merge the PR and close the issue)."},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/AGENTS.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| ## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)\n00002| \n00003| **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking.

It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6. Notify the producer that the PR is ready for review. Stop this process until the PR is reviewed and merged. Once reviewed and merged, proceed.\n00287| 7. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items\n00288| 8. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches\n00289| 9. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed\n00290| 10. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session\n00291| **CRITICAL RULES:**\n00292| \n00293| - Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds\n00294| - NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally\n00295| - NEVER say \"ready to push when you are\" - YOU must push\n00296| - If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds\n00297| - When using backticks in strings that are to be passed as arguments to shell commands (e.g. waif, gh), escape them properly to avoid errors\n00298| \n00299| ## Project structure\n00300| \n00301| - Source code lives in `src/`\n00302| - Tests live in `tests/`\n00303| - Documentation lives in `docs/`\n00304| - AI-generated planning docs go in `history/` (ephemeral)\n00305| - Beads configs live in `.beads/`\n00306| - Beads issues live in `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n00307| - OpenCode configs live in `.opencode`\n00308| - OpenCode agent commands live in `.opencode/command/` - these are not related to the WAFI CLI itself\n00309| \n\n(End of file - total 309 lines)\n</file>"},{"type":"file"},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/.github/copilot-instructions.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| # GitHub Copilot Instructions\n00002| \n00003| ## Issue Tracking with bd\n00004| \n00005| This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking - a Git-backed tracker designed for AI-supervised coding workflows.\n00006| \n00007| **Key Features:**\n00008| - Dependency-aware issue tracking\n00009| - Auto-sync with Git via JSONL\n00010| - AI-optimized CLI with JSON output\n00011| - Built-in daemon for background operations\n00012| - MCP server integration for Claude and other AI assistants\n00013| \n00014| **CRITICAL**: Use bd for ALL task tracking.

Safety gate: handle dirty working tree\n\n   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).\n   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-64m`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-64m --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-64m-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-64m-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-64m --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-64m --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file.

Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.\n00004| \n00005| ### Why bd?\n00006| \n00007| - Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues\n00008| - Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control\n00009| - Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links\n00010| - Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion\n00011| \n00012| ### Quick Start\n00013| \n00014| **Check for ready work:**\n00015| \n00016| ```bash\n00017| bd ready --json\n00018| ```\n00019| \n00020| **Create new issues:**\n00021| \n00022| ```bash\n00023| # For bugs and features, use templates for structured documentation\n00024| bd create \"Bug title\" --from-template bug -p 1 --json\n00025| bd create \"Feature title\" --from-template feature -p 2 --json\n00026| bd create \"Epic title\" --from-template epic -p 1 --json\n00027| \n00028| # For quick tasks/chores, skip templates\n00029| bd create \"Task title\" -t task -p 2 --json\n00030| bd create \"Chore title\" -t chore -p 3 --json\n00031| \n00032| # With dependencies or parent relationships\n00033| bd create \"Issue title\" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json\n00034| bd create \"Subtask\" --parent <epic-id> --json  # Hierarchical subtask (gets ID like epic-id.1)\n00035| ```\n00036| \n00037| **Claim and update:**\n00038| \n00039| ```bash\n00040| bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json\n00041| bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json\n00042| ```\n00043| \n00044| **Complete work:**\n00045| \n00046| ```bash\n00047| bd close bd-42 --reason \"Completed\" --json\n00048| ```\n00049| \n00050| ### Issue Types\n00051| \n00052| - `bug` - Something broken\n00053| - `feature` - New functionality\n00054| - `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)\n00055| - `epic` - Large feature with subtasks\n00056| - `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)\n00057| \n00058| ### Priorities\n00059| \n00060| - `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)\n00061| - `1` - High (major features, important bugs)\n00062| - `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)\n00063| - `3` - Low (polish, optimization)\n00064| - `4` - Backlog (future ideas)\n00065| \n00066| ### Workflow for AI Agents\n00067| \n00068| 1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues\n00069| 2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`\n00070| 3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document\n00071| 4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:\n00072|    - `bd create \"Found bug\" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`\n00073| 5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason \"Done\"`\n00074| 6. **Commit together**: Always commit the `.beads/issues.jsonl` file together with the code changes so issue state stays in sync with code state\n00075| \n00076| ### Using bv as an AI sidecar\n00077| \n00078| bv is a fast terminal UI for Beads projects (.beads/beads.jsonl). It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6. Notify the producer that the PR is ready for review. Stop this process until the PR is reviewed and merged. Once reviewed and merged, proceed.\n00287| 7. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items\n00288| 8. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches\n00289| 9. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed\n00290| 10. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session\n00291| **CRITICAL RULES:**\n00292| \n00293| - Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds\n00294| - NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally\n00295| - NEVER say \"ready to push when you are\" - YOU must push\n00296| - If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds\n00297| - When using backticks in strings that are to be passed as arguments to shell commands (e.g. waif, gh), escape them properly to avoid errors\n00298| \n00299| ## Project structure\n00300| \n00301| - Source code lives in `src/`\n00302| - Tests live in `tests/`\n00303| - Documentation lives in `docs/`\n00304| - AI-generated planning docs go in `history/` (ephemeral)\n00305| - Beads configs live in `.beads/`\n00306| - Beads issues live in `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n00307| - OpenCode configs live in `.opencode`\n00308| - OpenCode agent commands live in `.opencode/command/` - these are not related to the WAFI CLI itself\n00309| \n\n(End of file - total 309 lines)\n</file>"},{"type":"file"},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/.github/copilot-instructions.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| # GitHub Copilot Instructions\n00002| \n00003| ## Issue Tracking with bd\n00004| \n00005| This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking - a Git-backed tracker designed for AI-supervised coding workflows.\n00006| \n00007| **Key Features:**\n00008| - Dependency-aware issue tracking\n00009| - Auto-sync with Git via JSONL\n00010| - AI-optimized CLI with JSON output\n00011| - Built-in daemon for background operations\n00012| - MCP server integration for Claude and other AI assistants\n00013| \n00014| **CRITICAL**: Use bd for ALL task tracking.

Repo search (agent responsibility)\n\n   Use the user’s answers to derive 2–6 keywords. Then search for related artifacts.\n\n   - Search for likely PRDs/specs:\n     - Prefer scanning `docs/` and filenames containing `PRD`.\n     - Use ripgrep where available (where not available use an alternative, but ask the user to install ripgrep).\n     - Examples:\n       - `rg -n \"Product Requirements Document|\\bPRD\\b\" docs/`\n       - `rg -n \"<keyword1>|<keyword2>\" docs/ src/ README.md`\n   - Search for related Beads issues covering this topic (duplicates / precursors):\n     - Examples:\n       - `bd list --status open --json | rg -i \"<keyword>\"`\n       - `bd ready --json | rg -i \"<keyword>\"`\n     - If `rg` is unavailable, use a best-effort alternative and ask the user to install ripgrep.\n     - If you find candidates:\n       - List them as \"Related issues\" (ids + titles).\n       - If one clearly already represents this work, prefer updating that issue (or creating a child issue) instead of creating a duplicate.\n   - If you find candidates:\n     - List them as \"Likely duplicates / related docs\".\n     - Ask the user to confirm whether to update one of them.\n\n3.

Safety gate: handle dirty working tree\n\n   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).\n   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-3ur.1`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-3ur.1 --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-3ur.1-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-3ur.1-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-3ur.1 --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-3ur.1 --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file.

It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6. Notify the producer that the PR is ready for review. Stop this process until the PR is reviewed and merged. Once reviewed and merged, proceed.\n00287| 7. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items\n00288| 8. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches\n00289| 9. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed\n00290| 10. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session\n00291| **CRITICAL RULES:**\n00292| \n00293| - Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds\n00294| - NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally\n00295| - NEVER say \"ready to push when you are\" - YOU must push\n00296| - If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds\n00297| - When using backticks in strings that are to be passed as arguments to shell commands (e.g. waif, gh), escape them properly to avoid errors\n00298| \n00299| ## Project structure\n00300| \n00301| - Source code lives in `src/`\n00302| - Tests live in `tests/`\n00303| - Documentation lives in `docs/`\n00304| - AI-generated planning docs go in `history/` (ephemeral)\n00305| - Beads configs live in `.beads/`\n00306| - Beads issues live in `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n00307| - OpenCode configs live in `.opencode`\n00308| - OpenCode agent commands live in `.opencode/command/` - these are not related to the WAFI CLI itself\n00309| \n\n(End of file - total 309 lines)\n</file>"},{"type":"file"},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/.github/copilot-instructions.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| # GitHub Copilot Instructions\n00002| \n00003| ## Issue Tracking with bd\n00004| \n00005| This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking - a Git-backed tracker designed for AI-supervised coding workflows.\n00006| \n00007| **Key Features:**\n00008| - Dependency-aware issue tracking\n00009| - Auto-sync with Git via JSONL\n00010| - AI-optimized CLI with JSON output\n00011| - Built-in daemon for background operations\n00012| - MCP server integration for Claude and other AI assistants\n00013| \n00014| **CRITICAL**: Use bd for ALL task tracking.

Safety gate: handle dirty working tree\n\n   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).\n   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-3ur.1`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-3ur.1 --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-3ur.1-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-3ur.1-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-3ur.1 --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-3ur.1 --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file. Including a link to the PR. Provide hints on how to test any new functionality locally. Ask the user to review the PR and merge when ready.\n   - Ask the producer to provide feedback on the implementation and, if ready to do so, to instruct the agent to \"land the plane\" (merge the PR and close the issue)."},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/AGENTS.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| ## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)\n00002| \n00003| **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking.

It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6. Notify the producer that the PR is ready for review. Stop this process until the PR is reviewed and merged. Once reviewed and merged, proceed.\n00287| 7. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items\n00288| 8. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches\n00289| 9. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed\n00290| 10. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session\n00291| **CRITICAL RULES:**\n00292| \n00293| - Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds\n00294| - NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally\n00295| - NEVER say \"ready to push when you are\" - YOU must push\n00296| - If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds\n00297| - When using backticks in strings that are to be passed as arguments to shell commands (e.g. waif, gh), escape them properly to avoid errors\n00298| \n00299| ## Project structure\n00300| \n00301| - Source code lives in `src/`\n00302| - Tests live in `tests/`\n00303| - Documentation lives in `docs/`\n00304| - AI-generated planning docs go in `history/` (ephemeral)\n00305| - Beads configs live in `.beads/`\n00306| - Beads issues live in `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n00307| - OpenCode configs live in `.opencode`\n00308| - OpenCode agent commands live in `.opencode/command/` - these are not related to the WAFI CLI itself\n00309| \n\n(End of file - total 309 lines)\n</file>"},{"type":"file"},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/.github/copilot-instructions.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| # GitHub Copilot Instructions\n00002| \n00003| ## Issue Tracking with bd\n00004| \n00005| This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking - a Git-backed tracker designed for AI-supervised coding workflows.\n00006| \n00007| **Key Features:**\n00008| - Dependency-aware issue tracking\n00009| - Auto-sync with Git via JSONL\n00010| - AI-optimized CLI with JSON output\n00011| - Built-in daemon for background operations\n00012| - MCP server integration for Claude and other AI assistants\n00013| \n00014| **CRITICAL**: Use bd for ALL task tracking.

A feature branch already exists and is pushed: feature/wf-3ur.1-next-n and is tracking origin.\n- PRD updated at docs/dev/prd-command-next.md; intake recorded in wf-c2n (blocked by wf-3ur.1).\n- Current main code implementing waif next: src/commands/next.ts (read-only here). Tests live in tests/next.test.ts.\n- Decisions recorded for related search-prioritization: fuzzy matching via fuse.js, title +20% multiplier, description +10% multiplier, top_n candidate strategy (default 10 when search provided), search as positional arg. For this task we only implement the --number/-n option and top-N selection UX; search re-ranking (wf-c2n) will be a follow-up.

Behavior:\n   - Default behavior unchanged when -n absent (return single suggestion as before).\n   - When -n > 1 and not using --json: print a table with up to n rows showing columns: ID, Title, Priority, #blocked (reuse renderIssuesTable).

Add a new internal parameter/top_N usage in selectTop or a new helper that returns an ordered list rather than just top 1.\n\n3) Add/modify unit tests in tests/next.test.ts to cover:\n   - Default behavior unchanged (n not passed): single suggestion returned (human and JSON path).\n   - Passing -n 3 returns 3 items in JSON mode.\n   - Passing -n 2 human mode prints a table with 2 rows (assert using renderIssuesTable output shape or by parsing stdout).\n\n4) Ensure tests pass locally (npm test). Run `npm run build && npm test` and fix any types/tests failures.\n\n5) Commit changes on branch feature/wf-3ur.1-next-n with messages including the beads id (e.g., \"wf-3ur.1: add --number/-n to waif next\"). Push branch to origin and create a PR. Use gh CLI to create PR with title: \"wf-3ur.1: Add --number/-n option to waif next\" and body summarizing changes and linking the beads issue.

Safety gate: handle dirty working tree\n\n   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).\n   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-c2n`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-c2n --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-c2n-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-c2n-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-c2n --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-c2n --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file.

It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6. Notify the producer that the PR is ready for review. Stop this process until the PR is reviewed and merged. Once reviewed and merged, proceed.\n00287| 7. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items\n00288| 8. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches\n00289| 9. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed\n00290| 10. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session\n00291| **CRITICAL RULES:**\n00292| \n00293| - Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds\n00294| - NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally\n00295| - NEVER say \"ready to push when you are\" - YOU must push\n00296| - If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds\n00297| - When using backticks in strings that are to be passed as arguments to shell commands (e.g. waif, gh), escape them properly to avoid errors\n00298| \n00299| ## Project structure\n00300| \n00301| - Source code lives in `src/`\n00302| - Tests live in `tests/`\n00303| - Documentation lives in `docs/`\n00304| - AI-generated planning docs go in `history/` (ephemeral)\n00305| - Beads configs live in `.beads/`\n00306| - Beads issues live in `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n00307| - OpenCode configs live in `.opencode`\n00308| - OpenCode agent commands live in `.opencode/command/` - these are not related to the WAFI CLI itself\n00309| \n\n(End of file - total 309 lines)\n</file>"},{"type":"file"},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/.github/copilot-instructions.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| # GitHub Copilot Instructions\n00002| \n00003| ## Issue Tracking with bd\n00004| \n00005| This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking - a Git-backed tracker designed for AI-supervised coding workflows.\n00006| \n00007| **Key Features:**\n00008| - Dependency-aware issue tracking\n00009| - Auto-sync with Git via JSONL\n00010| - AI-optimized CLI with JSON output\n00011| - Built-in daemon for background operations\n00012| - MCP server integration for Claude and other AI assistants\n00013| \n00014| **CRITICAL**: Use bd for ALL task tracking.

Safety gate: handle dirty working tree\n\n   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).\n   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-c2n`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-c2n --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-c2n-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-c2n-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-c2n --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-c2n --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file. Including a link to the PR. Provide hints on how to test any new functionality locally. Ask the user to review the PR and merge when ready.\n   - Ask the producer to provide feedback on the implementation and, if ready to do so, to instruct the agent to \"land the plane\" (merge the PR and close the issue)."},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/AGENTS.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| ## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)\n00002| \n00003| **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking.

It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6. Notify the producer that the PR is ready for review. Stop this process until the PR is reviewed and merged. Once reviewed and merged, proceed.\n00287| 7. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items\n00288| 8. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches\n00289| 9. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed\n00290| 10. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session\n00291| **CRITICAL RULES:**\n00292| \n00293| - Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds\n00294| - NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally\n00295| - NEVER say \"ready to push when you are\" - YOU must push\n00296| - If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds\n00297| - When using backticks in strings that are to be passed as arguments to shell commands (e.g. waif, gh), escape them properly to avoid errors\n00298| \n00299| ## Project structure\n00300| \n00301| - Source code lives in `src/`\n00302| - Tests live in `tests/`\n00303| - Documentation lives in `docs/`\n00304| - AI-generated planning docs go in `history/` (ephemeral)\n00305| - Beads configs live in `.beads/`\n00306| - Beads issues live in `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n00307| - OpenCode configs live in `.opencode`\n00308| - OpenCode agent commands live in `.opencode/command/` - these are not related to the WAFI CLI itself\n00309| \n\n(End of file - total 309 lines)\n</file>"},{"type":"file"},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/.github/copilot-instructions.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| # GitHub Copilot Instructions\n00002| \n00003| ## Issue Tracking with bd\n00004| \n00005| This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking - a Git-backed tracker designed for AI-supervised coding workflows.\n00006| \n00007| **Key Features:**\n00008| - Dependency-aware issue tracking\n00009| - Auto-sync with Git via JSONL\n00010| - AI-optimized CLI with JSON output\n00011| - Built-in daemon for background operations\n00012| - MCP server integration for Claude and other AI assistants\n00013| \n00014| **CRITICAL**: Use bd for ALL task tracking.

Ensure you preserve the originalScore for each candidate (the bv score used by existing selection logic).\n\n3) Fuzzy matching\n  - Add dependency fuse.js (npm install --save fuse.js). Use separate Fuse instances for title and description.\n  - Configure Fuse with includeScore: true and reasonable threshold (0.6 is acceptable). Ensure matching is case-insensitive.\n  - For the set of candidates, run two searches (titleFuse.search and descFuse.search) with the provided search string to obtain per-candidate match scores.\n  - Convert Fuse scores to normalized match strengths in [0,1] where 1 = perfect match and 0 = no match. (Fuse returns score in [0,1] with 0 being exact; use match = 1 - fuseScore). If a candidate is not present in the search results, treat its match score as 0.\n\n4) Adjusted scoring and ranking\n  - For each candidate compute adjustedScore = originalScore * (1 + titleBoost * titleMatchScore + descBoost * descMatchScore)\n    - titleBoost = 0.20\n    - descBoost = 0.10\n  - Sort candidates by adjustedScore descending. For deterministic tie-breaking, if adjustedScore equal use originalScore descending, then id lexicographic ascending.\n\n5) No-match fallback\n  - If none of the top-N candidates have titleMatchScore > 0 or descMatchScore > 0 (i.e., all zero), treat as no-match: revert to using the original selection from selectTopN (the pre-ranked order) and print a clear human output message: \"Search: no-match; using default recommendation\".\n  - JSON output must remain unchanged in no-match case (same contract as before).\n\n6) Output contract\n  - Do NOT add match metadata to JSON output. The --json output must be the same shape as existing behavior: selected issue(s) only.\n  - Human output: when a search is applied and matches exist, show the re-ranked list (same table format as current -n behavior) and indicate that search was applied. When no-match, show message noted above and show default recommendation.\n  - Clipboard behavior: copy only the first recommended id (same as current behavior), best-effort and must not fail the command.\n\n7) Tests\n  - Add unit tests demonstrating:\n    a) Search re-ranking: a candidate with slightly lower originalScore should be promoted above a higher-scoring candidate when it has a strong title match for the search string.\n    b) No-match fallback: when search matches none of the top-N candidates, fallback to original selection and a visible no-match message.\n  - Tests should live in tests/ (either extend tests/next.test.ts or add tests/next-search.test.ts). Use existing test helpers/mocks to create deterministic bv/selectTopN behavior.\n\n8) Quality gates and CI\n  - Run npm install to add dependency, run npm run build (if applicable), and npm test locally. Tests must pass.\n\n9) Commits / PR / beads updates\n  - Make commits on branch feature/wf-c2n-search-priority. Commit message style:\n    \"wf-c2n: add search-prioritized re-ranking to waif next (fuse.js, top_n=10, title+20%, desc+10%)\"\n  - Push branch to origin and open a PR with title \"wf-c2n: waif next search-prioritized issue selection\".

Ensure you preserve the originalScore for each candidate (the bv score used by existing selection logic).\n\n3) Fuzzy matching\n  - Add dependency fuse.js (npm install --save fuse.js). Use separate Fuse instances for title and description.\n  - Configure Fuse with includeScore: true and reasonable threshold (0.6 is acceptable). Ensure matching is case-insensitive.\n  - For the set of candidates, run two searches (titleFuse.search and descFuse.search) with the provided search string to obtain per-candidate match scores.\n  - Convert Fuse scores to normalized match strengths in [0,1] where 1 = perfect match and 0 = no match. (Fuse returns score in [0,1] with 0 being exact; use match = 1 - fuseScore). If a candidate is not present in the search results, treat its match score as 0.\n\n4) Adjusted scoring and ranking\n  - For each candidate compute adjustedScore = originalScore * (1 + titleBoost * titleMatchScore + descBoost * descMatchScore)\n    - titleBoost = 0.20\n    - descBoost = 0.10\n  - Sort candidates by adjustedScore descending. For deterministic tie-breaking, if adjustedScore equal use originalScore descending, then id lexicographic ascending.\n\n5) No-match fallback\n  - If none of the top-N candidates have titleMatchScore > 0 or descMatchScore > 0 (i.e., all zero), treat as no-match: revert to using the original selection from selectTopN (the pre-ranked order) and print a clear human output message: \"Search: no-match; using default recommendation\".\n  - JSON output must remain unchanged in no-match case (same contract as before).\n\n6) Output contract\n  - Do NOT add match metadata to JSON output. The --json output must be the same shape as existing behavior: selected issue(s) only.\n  - Human output: when a search is applied and matches exist, show the re-ranked list (same table format as current -n behavior) and indicate that search was applied. When no-match, show message noted above and show default recommendation.\n  - Clipboard behavior: copy only the first recommended id (same as current behavior), best-effort and must not fail the command.\n\n7) Tests\n  - Add unit tests demonstrating:\n    a) Search re-ranking: a candidate with slightly lower originalScore should be promoted above a higher-scoring candidate when it has a strong title match for the search string.\n    b) No-match fallback: when search matches none of the top-N candidates, fallback to original selection and a visible no-match message.\n  - Tests should live in tests/ (either extend tests/next.test.ts or add tests/next-search.test.ts). Use existing test helpers/mocks to create deterministic bv/selectTopN behavior.\n\n8) Quality gates and CI\n  - Run npm install to add dependency, run npm run build (if applicable), and npm test locally. Tests must pass.\n\n9) Commits / PR / beads updates\n  - Make commits on branch feature/wf-c2n-search-priority. Commit message style:\n    \"wf-c2n: add search-prioritized re-ranking to waif next (fuse.js, top_n=10, title+20%, desc+10%)\"\n  - Push branch to origin and open a PR with title \"wf-c2n: waif next search-prioritized issue selection\".

Safety gate: handle dirty working tree\n\n   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).\n   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-ba2.5.2 NOTE no code changes, docs only`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-ba2.5.2 NOTE no code changes, docs only --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-ba2.5.2 NOTE no code changes, docs only-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-ba2.5.2 NOTE no code changes, docs only-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-ba2.5.2 NOTE no code changes, docs only --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-ba2.5.2 NOTE no code changes, docs only --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file. Including a link to the PR. Provide hints on how to test any new functionality locally. Ask the user to review the PR and merge when ready.\n   - Ask the producer to provide feedback on the implementation and, if ready to do so, to instruct the agent to \"land the plane\" (merge the PR and close the issue)."},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/AGENTS.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| ## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)\n00002| \n00003| **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking.

It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6. Notify the producer that the PR is ready for review. Stop this process until the PR is reviewed and merged. Once reviewed and merged, proceed.\n00287| 7. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items\n00288| 8. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches\n00289| 9. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed\n00290| 10. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session\n00291| **CRITICAL RULES:**\n00292| \n00293| - Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds\n00294| - NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally\n00295| - NEVER say \"ready to push when you are\" - YOU must push\n00296| - If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds\n00297| - When using backticks in strings that are to be passed as arguments to shell commands (e.g. waif, gh), escape them properly to avoid errors\n00298| \n00299| ## Project structure\n00300| \n00301| - Source code lives in `src/`\n00302| - Tests live in `tests/`\n00303| - Documentation lives in `docs/`\n00304| - AI-generated planning docs go in `history/` (ephemeral)\n00305| - Beads configs live in `.beads/`\n00306| - Beads issues live in `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n00307| - OpenCode configs live in `.opencode`\n00308| - OpenCode agent commands live in `.opencode/command/` - these are not related to the WAFI CLI itself\n00309| \n\n(End of file - total 309 lines)\n</file>"},{"type":"file"},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/.github/copilot-instructions.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| # GitHub Copilot Instructions\n00002| \n00003| ## Issue Tracking with bd\n00004| \n00005| This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking - a Git-backed tracker designed for AI-supervised coding workflows.\n00006| \n00007| **Key Features:**\n00008| - Dependency-aware issue tracking\n00009| - Auto-sync with Git via JSONL\n00010| - AI-optimized CLI with JSON output\n00011| - Built-in daemon for background operations\n00012| - MCP server integration for Claude and other AI assistants\n00013| \n00014| **CRITICAL**: Use bd for ALL task tracking.

Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-ba2.5.2 NOTE no code changes, docs only`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-ba2.5.2 NOTE no code changes, docs only --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-ba2.5.2 NOTE no code changes, docs only-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-ba2.5.2 NOTE no code changes, docs only-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-ba2.5.2 NOTE no code changes, docs only --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-ba2.5.2 NOTE no code changes, docs only --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file.

Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.\n00004| \n00005| ### Why bd?\n00006| \n00007| - Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues\n00008| - Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control\n00009| - Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links\n00010| - Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion\n00011| \n00012| ### Quick Start\n00013| \n00014| **Check for ready work:**\n00015| \n00016| ```bash\n00017| bd ready --json\n00018| ```\n00019| \n00020| **Create new issues:**\n00021| \n00022| ```bash\n00023| # For bugs and features, use templates for structured documentation\n00024| bd create \"Bug title\" --from-template bug -p 1 --json\n00025| bd create \"Feature title\" --from-template feature -p 2 --json\n00026| bd create \"Epic title\" --from-template epic -p 1 --json\n00027| \n00028| # For quick tasks/chores, skip templates\n00029| bd create \"Task title\" -t task -p 2 --json\n00030| bd create \"Chore title\" -t chore -p 3 --json\n00031| \n00032| # With dependencies or parent relationships\n00033| bd create \"Issue title\" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json\n00034| bd create \"Subtask\" --parent <epic-id> --json  # Hierarchical subtask (gets ID like epic-id.1)\n00035| ```\n00036| \n00037| **Claim and update:**\n00038| \n00039| ```bash\n00040| bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json\n00041| bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json\n00042| ```\n00043| \n00044| **Complete work:**\n00045| \n00046| ```bash\n00047| bd close bd-42 --reason \"Completed\" --json\n00048| ```\n00049| \n00050| ### Issue Types\n00051| \n00052| - `bug` - Something broken\n00053| - `feature` - New functionality\n00054| - `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)\n00055| - `epic` - Large feature with subtasks\n00056| - `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)\n00057| \n00058| ### Priorities\n00059| \n00060| - `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)\n00061| - `1` - High (major features, important bugs)\n00062| - `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)\n00063| - `3` - Low (polish, optimization)\n00064| - `4` - Backlog (future ideas)\n00065| \n00066| ### Workflow for AI Agents\n00067| \n00068| 1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues\n00069| 2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`\n00070| 3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document\n00071| 4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:\n00072|    - `bd create \"Found bug\" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`\n00073| 5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason \"Done\"`\n00074| 6. **Commit together**: Always commit the `.beads/issues.jsonl` file together with the code changes so issue state stays in sync with code state\n00075| \n00076| ### Using bv as an AI sidecar\n00077| \n00078| bv is a fast terminal UI for Beads projects (.beads/beads.jsonl). It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6. Notify the producer that the PR is ready for review. Stop this process until the PR is reviewed and merged. Once reviewed and merged, proceed.\n00287| 7. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items\n00288| 8. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches\n00289| 9. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed\n00290| 10. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session\n00291| **CRITICAL RULES:**\n00292| \n00293| - Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds\n00294| - NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally\n00295| - NEVER say \"ready to push when you are\" - YOU must push\n00296| - If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds\n00297| - When using backticks in strings that are to be passed as arguments to shell commands (e.g. waif, gh), escape them properly to avoid errors\n00298| \n00299| ## Project structure\n00300| \n00301| - Source code lives in `src/`\n00302| - Tests live in `tests/`\n00303| - Documentation lives in `docs/`\n00304| - AI-generated planning docs go in `history/` (ephemeral)\n00305| - Beads configs live in `.beads/`\n00306| - Beads issues live in `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n00307| - OpenCode configs live in `.opencode`\n00308| - OpenCode agent commands live in `.opencode/command/` - these are not related to the WAFI CLI itself\n00309| \n\n(End of file - total 309 lines)\n</file>"},{"type":"file"},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/.github/copilot-instructions.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| # GitHub Copilot Instructions\n00002| \n00003| ## Issue Tracking with bd\n00004| \n00005| This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking - a Git-backed tracker designed for AI-supervised coding workflows.\n00006| \n00007| **Key Features:**\n00008| - Dependency-aware issue tracking\n00009| - Auto-sync with Git via JSONL\n00010| - AI-optimized CLI with JSON output\n00011| - Built-in daemon for background operations\n00012| - MCP server integration for Claude and other AI assistants\n00013| \n00014| **CRITICAL**: Use bd for ALL task tracking.

Agents should prefer a live bd/CLI query for current state; if a snapshot is embedded, include an explicit timestamp and redact/truncate notes over 200 characters.\n\nAllowed (to include in a context pack)\n\n- Beads metadata items: id, title, status, priority, labels, external_ref (PR), updated_at, and a one-line summary or notes field (trimmed to ~200 chars).\n- Use these only as metadata lines (path: .beads/issues.jsonl pointer + small manifest), not the full JSONL blob.\n- Example manifest entry:\n\n  {\"id\":\"wf-ba2.5.2\",\"title\":\"Context selection strategy\",\"status\":\"in_progress\",\"labels\":[\"milestone:M4\"],\"external_ref\":\"gh-PR: https://github.com/SorraTheOrc/waif/pull/84\",\"updated_at\":\"2025-12-30T14:06:26Z\",\"notes\":\"Opened PR https://github.com/SorraTheOrc/waif/pull/84 (docs-only)\"}\n\nDisallowed\n\n- Full .beads/issues.jsonl dumps or copying all issues into the context pack.\n- Private notes, internal audit lines, or any content from beads that appears to be a secret.\n- Historical/verbose blobs that exceed per-file limits.\n\nHow agents should consume beads state\n\n- Query live via bd/CLI or API to get current status; prefer live lookup rather than embedding a snapshot.\n- If a snapshot is embedded, limit to the allowed metadata fields and include an explicit timestamp and pointer to the source file or bd query used.\n- Respect redaction rules: trim notes >200 chars, redact any email/credentials discovered in notes, and mark redactions in the audit manifest.\n\nWhen to include beads metadata\n\n- During PR review, when generating PRD or context for an ongoing issue, or when requests explicitly reference a bead ID.\n- Avoid including beads metadata when building generic context packs for unrelated tasks (it adds noise).\n\n3) Update the Acceptance criteria section in docs/dev/context_selection_strategy.md to include a bullet: \"Includes guidance for minimal Beads metadata allowed in context packs (id, title, status, labels, external_ref, updated_at) and an example manifest.\" If the Acceptance criteria section is absent, add it; otherwise append the bullet.\n\n4) Update history/wf-ba2.5.2-notes.md to append a short note: \"Added Beads metadata guidance to docs/dev/context_selection_strategy.md (see PR #84).\"\n\n5) Stage and commit the changes with message: \"wf-ba2.5.2 docs: include beads metadata guidance (docs-only)\". Ensure commit includes .beads if it was modified; do NOT modify .beads unless required. If there are unstaged unrelated changes, abort and report.\n\n6) Run npm test and ensure tests pass. If tests fail, abort and report output.\n\n7) Push the branch to origin and update the existing PR (PR URL is https://github.com/SorraTheOrc/waif/pull/84). If the PR cannot be updated for any reason, create or update a PR and return the PR URL.\n\n8) Update the beads issue wf-ba2.5.2 with bd update to add a note: \"Added Beads metadata guidance in docs; updated PR https://github.com/SorraTheOrc/waif/pull/84\" and include the PR URL as external_ref if not already present. Then run bd sync.\n\n9) Return a single message listing exactly:\n- Files edited (paths)\n- Git commands executed (in order)\n- Test results (pass/fail and summary)\n- PR URL\n- Beads issue state after update (output of bd show wf-ba2.5.2 or bd update response)\n- Any risks or follow-ups\n\nDo not perform any destructive git commands (no force push, no branch deletions). If any step fails, stop and report the failure and its output.\n"}]}}

the PM indirectly benefits via faster/safer agent execution.\\n\\nSuccess criteria\\n- `waif context` (alias: `waif ctx`) generates/updates a single agent-oriented “signpost” document: `docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md`.\\n- The context pack provides “minimum efficient” discovery:\\n  - Links to all important docs (PRDs/specs, user docs, workflow rules, issue tracking rules, agent roles, key source folders).\\n  - Each entry includes a short description (1–2 bullets) describing what it contains and when to read it.\\n  - Large docs may be referenced multiple times, pointing at specific sections.\\n- The pack avoids rapidly-changing content; instead it points to the canonical way to query it (e.g., it does not list active Beads issues, but explains how to query for ready/active work).\\n- Soft size limit: ~20,000 tokens.\\n  - If generation exceeds the limit, still write the file AND create/update a P0 Beads issue assigned to the PM flagging that the context pack has exceeded the target and needs strategy/partitioning.\\n\\nConstraints\\n- Ignore/redaction boundaries are defined by `.gitignore`.\\n  - Ignored content must not be included; “omitted but redacted” summaries are acceptable.\\n- Initial scope (this iteration): implement the `waif context|ctx` command to create/update the context pack.\\n- Out of scope (this iteration): defining/automating rules for when agents must file “request context update” issues after significant changes.\\n- This document is intended for agent consumption, not human consumption.\\n\\nExisting state (current behavior)\\n- `docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md` recommends a `context`/`ctx` command that generates `docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md`, but the command and template do not currently exist.\\n- Project structure/rules are spread across multiple docs; there is no single agent-first index.\\n\\nDesired change\\n- Implement/ship a CLI command `waif context` (alias `waif ctx`) that generates/updates `docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md` from a stable template.\\n- Ensure ignore boundary compliance via `.gitignore`.\\n- Implement the “20,000 token” soft limit behavior: write the file and create/update a P0 issue assigned to the PM when exceeded.\\n\\nLikely duplicates / related docs (file paths)\\n- docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md (mentions `context`/`ctx` utility command)\\n- docs/dev/TUI_PRD.md (mentions context sharing with OpenCode;

Minimum required section outline for `docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md` (top-level headings) so the generator stays stable?\\n2. How should “~20,000 tokens” be measured (approximate by characters/words, or via a tokenizer implementation)?\\n3. P0 issue strategy on overflow: one long-lived issue updated each time vs create a new P0 each time?\\n4. Should `waif ctx` enumerate PRDs/specs by scanning `docs/dev/*PRD*.md`, or rely on a curated allowlist?\\n5. Should ordering be deterministic (stable sort by path/title) to reduce diff noise?\\n\\nProposed next step\\n- NEW PRD at: docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md\\n- Recommended next command: /prd docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md wf-ba2.5.4\\n\",\n        \"notes\": \"Decision update: This work warrants a NEW PRD (large/important feature).

Safety gate: handle dirty working tree\n\n   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).\n   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-ba2.5.4.1`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.1 --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-ba2.5.4.1-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-ba2.5.4.1-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.1 --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-ba2.5.4.1 --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file. Including a link to the PR. Provide hints on how to test any new functionality locally. Ask the user to review the PR and merge when ready.\n   - Ask the producer to provide feedback on the implementation and, if ready to do so, to instruct the agent to \"land the plane\" (merge the PR and close the issue)."},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/AGENTS.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| ## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)\n00002| \n00003| **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking.

It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6. Notify the producer that the PR is ready for review. Stop this process until the PR is reviewed and merged.

the PM indirectly benefits via faster/safer agent execution.\\n\\nSuccess criteria\\n- `waif context` (alias: `waif ctx`) generates/updates a single agent-oriented “signpost” document: `docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md`.\\n- The context pack provides “minimum efficient” discovery:\\n  - Links to all important docs (PRDs/specs, user docs, workflow rules, issue tracking rules, agent roles, key source folders).\\n  - Each entry includes a short description (1–2 bullets) describing what it contains and when to read it.\\n  - Large docs may be referenced multiple times, pointing at specific sections.\\n- The pack avoids rapidly-changing content; instead it points to the canonical way to query it (e.g., it does not list active Beads issues, but explains how to query for ready/active work).\\n- Soft size limit: ~20,000 tokens.\\n  - If generation exceeds the limit, still write the file AND create/update a P0 Beads issue assigned to the PM flagging that the context pack has exceeded the target and needs strategy/partitioning.\\n\\nConstraints\\n- Ignore/redaction boundaries are defined by `.gitignore`.\\n  - Ignored content must not be included; “omitted but redacted” summaries are acceptable.\\n- Initial scope (this iteration): implement the `waif context|ctx` command to create/update the context pack.\\n- Out of scope (this iteration): defining/automating rules for when agents must file “request context update” issues after significant changes.\\n- This document is intended for agent consumption, not human consumption.\\n\\nExisting state (current behavior)\\n- `docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md` recommends a `context`/`ctx` command that generates `docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md`, but the command and template do not currently exist.\\n- Project structure/rules are spread across multiple docs; there is no single agent-first index.\\n\\nDesired change\\n- Implement/ship a CLI command `waif context` (alias `waif ctx`) that generates/updates `docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md` from a stable template.\\n- Ensure ignore boundary compliance via `.gitignore`.\\n- Implement the “20,000 token” soft limit behavior: write the file and create/update a P0 issue assigned to the PM when exceeded.\\n\\nLikely duplicates / related docs (file paths)\\n- docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md (mentions `context`/`ctx` utility command)\\n- docs/dev/TUI_PRD.md (mentions context sharing with OpenCode; ignore boundaries)\\n- docs/Workflow.md (workflow rules that the context pack should signpost)\\n- docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md (canonical Context Pack PRD)\\n\\nRelated issues (Beads ids)\\n- wf-7cn: Docs: Implement Context Pack command and template\\n- wf-ba2.5: Context Gathering + .gitignore Guards (epic)\\n- wf-ba2.5.1: .gitignore guards for reads + writes (hard enforcement)\\n- wf-ba2.5.2: Context selection strategy (eligible repo context)\\n- wf-ba2.9.4: Tests: .gitignore enforcement\\n- wf-ba2.5.5: Instruct agents to file context pack update requests\\n\\nClarifying questions\\n1. Minimum required section outline for `docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md` (top-level headings) so the generator stays stable?\\n2. How should “~20,000 tokens” be measured (approximate by characters/words, or via a tokenizer implementation)?\\n3. P0 issue strategy on overflow: one long-lived issue updated each time vs create a new P0 each time?\\n4. Should `waif ctx` enumerate PRDs/specs by scanning `docs/dev/*PRD*.md`, or rely on a curated allowlist?\\n5. Should ordering be deterministic (stable sort by path/title) to reduce diff noise?\\n\\nProposed next step\\n- NEW PRD at: docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md\\n- Recommended next command: /prd docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md wf-ba2.5.4\\n\",\n        \"notes\": \"Decision update: This work warrants a NEW PRD (large/important feature).

Safety gate: handle dirty working tree\n\n   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).\n   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-ba2.5.4.1`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.1 --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-ba2.5.4.1-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-ba2.5.4.1-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.1 --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-ba2.5.4.1 --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file. Including a link to the PR. Provide hints on how to test any new functionality locally. Ask the user to review the PR and merge when ready.\n   - Ask the producer to provide feedback on the implementation and, if ready to do so, to instruct the agent to \"land the plane\" (merge the PR and close the issue)."},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/AGENTS.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| ## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)\n00002| \n00003| **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking.

It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6. Notify the producer that the PR is ready for review. Stop this process until the PR is reviewed and merged. Once reviewed and merged, proceed.\n00287| 7. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items\n00288| 8. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches\n00289| 9. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed\n00290| 10. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session\n00291| **CRITICAL RULES:**\n00292| \n00293| - Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds\n00294| - NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally\n00295| - NEVER say \"ready to push when you are\" - YOU must push\n00296| - If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds\n00297| - When using backticks in strings that are to be passed as arguments to shell commands (e.g. waif, gh), escape them properly to avoid errors\n00298| \n00299| ## Project structure\n00300| \n00301| - Source code lives in `src/`\n00302| - Tests live in `tests/`\n00303| - Documentation lives in `docs/`\n00304| - AI-generated planning docs go in `history/` (ephemeral)\n00305| - Beads configs live in `.beads/`\n00306| - Beads issues live in `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n00307| - OpenCode configs live in `.opencode`\n00308| - OpenCode agent commands live in `.opencode/command/` - these are not related to the WAFI CLI itself\n00309| \n\n(End of file - total 309 lines)\n</file>"},{"type":"file"},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/.github/copilot-instructions.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| # GitHub Copilot Instructions\n00002| \n00003| ## Issue Tracking with bd\n00004| \n00005| This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking - a Git-backed tracker designed for AI-supervised coding workflows.\n00006| \n00007| **Key Features:**\n00008| - Dependency-aware issue tracking\n00009| - Auto-sync with Git via JSONL\n00010| - AI-optimized CLI with JSON output\n00011| - Built-in daemon for background operations\n00012| - MCP server integration for Claude and other AI assistants\n00013| \n00014| **CRITICAL**: Use bd for ALL task tracking.

Safety gate: handle dirty working tree\n\n   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).\n   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-ba2.5.4.`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-ba2.5.4. --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-ba2.5.4.-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-ba2.5.4.-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-ba2.5.4. --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-ba2.5.4. --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8.

It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6. Notify the producer that the PR is ready for review. Stop this process until the PR is reviewed and merged. Once reviewed and merged, proceed.\n00287| 7. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items\n00288| 8. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches\n00289| 9. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed\n00290| 10. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session\n00291| **CRITICAL RULES:**\n00292| \n00293| - Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds\n00294| - NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally\n00295| - NEVER say \"ready to push when you are\" - YOU must push\n00296| - If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds\n00297| - When using backticks in strings that are to be passed as arguments to shell commands (e.g. waif, gh), escape them properly to avoid errors\n00298| \n00299| ## Project structure\n00300| \n00301| - Source code lives in `src/`\n00302| - Tests live in `tests/`\n00303| - Documentation lives in `docs/`\n00304| - AI-generated planning docs go in `history/` (ephemeral)\n00305| - Beads configs live in `.beads/`\n00306| - Beads issues live in `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n00307| - OpenCode configs live in `.opencode`\n00308| - OpenCode agent commands live in `.opencode/command/` - these are not related to the WAFI CLI itself\n00309| \n\n(End of file - total 309 lines)\n</file>"},{"type":"file"},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/.github/copilot-instructions.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| # GitHub Copilot Instructions\n00002| \n00003| ## Issue Tracking with bd\n00004| \n00005| This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking - a Git-backed tracker designed for AI-supervised coding workflows.\n00006| \n00007| **Key Features:**\n00008| - Dependency-aware issue tracking\n00009| - Auto-sync with Git via JSONL\n00010| - AI-optimized CLI with JSON output\n00011| - Built-in daemon for background operations\n00012| - MCP server integration for Claude and other AI assistants\n00013| \n00014| **CRITICAL**: Use bd for ALL task tracking.

Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-ba2.5.4.`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-ba2.5.4. --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-ba2.5.4.-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-ba2.5.4.-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-ba2.5.4. --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-ba2.5.4. --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file. Including a link to the PR. Provide hints on how to test any new functionality locally. Ask the user to review the PR and merge when ready.\n   - Ask the producer to provide feedback on the implementation and, if ready to do so, to instruct the agent to \"land the plane\" (merge the PR and close the issue)."},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/AGENTS.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| ## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)\n00002| \n00003| **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.\n00004| \n00005| ### Why bd?\n00006| \n00007| - Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues\n00008| - Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control\n00009| - Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links\n00010| - Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion\n00011| \n00012| ### Quick Start\n00013| \n00014| **Check for ready work:**\n00015| \n00016| ```bash\n00017| bd ready --json\n00018| ```\n00019| \n00020| **Create new issues:**\n00021| \n00022| ```bash\n00023| # For bugs and features, use templates for structured documentation\n00024| bd create \"Bug title\" --from-template bug -p 1 --json\n00025| bd create \"Feature title\" --from-template feature -p 2 --json\n00026| bd create \"Epic title\" --from-template epic -p 1 --json\n00027| \n00028| # For quick tasks/chores, skip templates\n00029| bd create \"Task title\" -t task -p 2 --json\n00030| bd create \"Chore title\" -t chore -p 3 --json\n00031| \n00032| # With dependencies or parent relationships\n00033| bd create \"Issue title\" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json\n00034| bd create \"Subtask\" --parent <epic-id> --json  # Hierarchical subtask (gets ID like epic-id.1)\n00035| ```\n00036| \n00037| **Claim and update:**\n00038| \n00039| ```bash\n00040| bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json\n00041| bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json\n00042| ```\n00043| \n00044| **Complete work:**\n00045| \n00046| ```bash\n00047| bd close bd-42 --reason \"Completed\" --json\n00048| ```\n00049| \n00050| ### Issue Types\n00051| \n00052| - `bug` - Something broken\n00053| - `feature` - New functionality\n00054| - `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)\n00055| - `epic` - Large feature with subtasks\n00056| - `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)\n00057| \n00058| ### Priorities\n00059| \n00060| - `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)\n00061| - `1` - High (major features, important bugs)\n00062| - `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)\n00063| - `3` - Low (polish, optimization)\n00064| - `4` - Backlog (future ideas)\n00065| \n00066| ### Workflow for AI Agents\n00067| \n00068| 1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues\n00069| 2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`\n00070| 3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document\n00071| 4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:\n00072|    - `bd create \"Found bug\" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`\n00073| 5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason \"Done\"`\n00074| 6. **Commit together**: Always commit the `.beads/issues.jsonl` file together with the code changes so issue state stays in sync with code state\n00075| \n00076| ### Using bv as an AI sidecar\n00077| \n00078| bv is a fast terminal UI for Beads projects (.beads/beads.jsonl). It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6.

Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-ba2.5.4.1`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.1 --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-ba2.5.4.1-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-ba2.5.4.1-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.1 --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-ba2.5.4.1 --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file. Including a link to the PR. Provide hints on how to test any new functionality locally. Ask the user to review the PR and merge when ready.\n   - Ask the producer to provide feedback on the implementation and, if ready to do so, to instruct the agent to \"land the plane\" (merge the PR and close the issue)."},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/AGENTS.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| ## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)\n00002| \n00003| **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.\n00004| \n00005| ### Why bd?\n00006| \n00007| - Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues\n00008| - Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control\n00009| - Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links\n00010| - Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion\n00011| \n00012| ### Quick Start\n00013| \n00014| **Check for ready work:**\n00015| \n00016| ```bash\n00017| bd ready --json\n00018| ```\n00019| \n00020| **Create new issues:**\n00021| \n00022| ```bash\n00023| # For bugs and features, use templates for structured documentation\n00024| bd create \"Bug title\" --from-template bug -p 1 --json\n00025| bd create \"Feature title\" --from-template feature -p 2 --json\n00026| bd create \"Epic title\" --from-template epic -p 1 --json\n00027| \n00028| # For quick tasks/chores, skip templates\n00029| bd create \"Task title\" -t task -p 2 --json\n00030| bd create \"Chore title\" -t chore -p 3 --json\n00031| \n00032| # With dependencies or parent relationships\n00033| bd create \"Issue title\" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json\n00034| bd create \"Subtask\" --parent <epic-id> --json  # Hierarchical subtask (gets ID like epic-id.1)\n00035| ```\n00036| \n00037| **Claim and update:**\n00038| \n00039| ```bash\n00040| bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json\n00041| bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json\n00042| ```\n00043| \n00044| **Complete work:**\n00045| \n00046| ```bash\n00047| bd close bd-42 --reason \"Completed\" --json\n00048| ```\n00049| \n00050| ### Issue Types\n00051| \n00052| - `bug` - Something broken\n00053| - `feature` - New functionality\n00054| - `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)\n00055| - `epic` - Large feature with subtasks\n00056| - `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)\n00057| \n00058| ### Priorities\n00059| \n00060| - `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)\n00061| - `1` - High (major features, important bugs)\n00062| - `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)\n00063| - `3` - Low (polish, optimization)\n00064| - `4` - Backlog (future ideas)\n00065| \n00066| ### Workflow for AI Agents\n00067| \n00068| 1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues\n00069| 2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`\n00070| 3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document\n00071| 4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:\n00072|    - `bd create \"Found bug\" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`\n00073| 5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason \"Done\"`\n00074| 6. **Commit together**: Always commit the `.beads/issues.jsonl` file together with the code changes so issue state stays in sync with code state\n00075| \n00076| ### Using bv as an AI sidecar\n00077| \n00078| bv is a fast terminal UI for Beads projects (.beads/beads.jsonl). It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6.

Safety gate: handle dirty working tree\n\n   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).\n   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-ba2.5.4.1`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.1 --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-ba2.5.4.1-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-ba2.5.4.1-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.1 --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-ba2.5.4.1 --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file. Including a link to the PR. Provide hints on how to test any new functionality locally. Ask the user to review the PR and merge when ready.\n   - Ask the producer to provide feedback on the implementation and, if ready to do so, to instruct the agent to \"land the plane\" (merge the PR and close the issue)."},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/AGENTS.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| ## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)\n00002| \n00003| **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking.

It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6. Notify the producer that the PR is ready for review. Stop this process until the PR is reviewed and merged. Once reviewed and merged, proceed.\n00287| 7. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items\n00288| 8. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches\n00289| 9. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed\n00290| 10. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session\n00291| **CRITICAL RULES:**\n00292| \n00293| - Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds\n00294| - NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally\n00295| - NEVER say \"ready to push when you are\" - YOU must push\n00296| - If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds\n00297| - When using backticks in strings that are to be passed as arguments to shell commands (e.g. waif, gh), escape them properly to avoid errors\n00298| \n00299| ## Project structure\n00300| \n00301| - Source code lives in `src/`\n00302| - Tests live in `tests/`\n00303| - Documentation lives in `docs/`\n00304| - AI-generated planning docs go in `history/` (ephemeral)\n00305| - Beads configs live in `.beads/`\n00306| - Beads issues live in `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n00307| - OpenCode configs live in `.opencode`\n00308| - OpenCode agent commands live in `.opencode/command/` - these are not related to the WAFI CLI itself\n00309| \n\n(End of file - total 309 lines)\n</file>"},{"type":"file"},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/.github/copilot-instructions.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| # GitHub Copilot Instructions\n00002| \n00003| ## Issue Tracking with bd\n00004| \n00005| This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking - a Git-backed tracker designed for AI-supervised coding workflows.\n00006| \n00007| **Key Features:**\n00008| - Dependency-aware issue tracking\n00009| - Auto-sync with Git via JSONL\n00010| - AI-optimized CLI with JSON output\n00011| - Built-in daemon for background operations\n00012| - MCP server integration for Claude and other AI assistants\n00013| \n00014| **CRITICAL**: Use bd for ALL task tracking.

Safety gate: handle dirty working tree\n\n   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).\n   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-ba2.5.4.2`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.2 --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-ba2.5.4.2-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-ba2.5.4.2-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.2 --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-ba2.5.4.2 --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file. Including a link to the PR. Provide hints on how to test any new functionality locally. Ask the user to review the PR and merge when ready.\n   - Ask the producer to provide feedback on the implementation and, if ready to do so, to instruct the agent to \"land the plane\" (merge the PR and close the issue)."},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/AGENTS.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| ## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)\n00002| \n00003| **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking.

It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6. Notify the producer that the PR is ready for review. Stop this process until the PR is reviewed and merged. Once reviewed and merged, proceed.\n00287| 7. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items\n00288| 8. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches\n00289| 9. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed\n00290| 10. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session\n00291| **CRITICAL RULES:**\n00292| \n00293| - Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds\n00294| - NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally\n00295| - NEVER say \"ready to push when you are\" - YOU must push\n00296| - If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds\n00297| - When using backticks in strings that are to be passed as arguments to shell commands (e.g. waif, gh), escape them properly to avoid errors\n00298| \n00299| ## Project structure\n00300| \n00301| - Source code lives in `src/`\n00302| - Tests live in `tests/`\n00303| - Documentation lives in `docs/`\n00304| - AI-generated planning docs go in `history/` (ephemeral)\n00305| - Beads configs live in `.beads/`\n00306| - Beads issues live in `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n00307| - OpenCode configs live in `.opencode`\n00308| - OpenCode agent commands live in `.opencode/command/` - these are not related to the WAFI CLI itself\n00309| \n\n(End of file - total 309 lines)\n</file>"},{"type":"file"},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/.github/copilot-instructions.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| # GitHub Copilot Instructions\n00002| \n00003| ## Issue Tracking with bd\n00004| \n00005| This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking - a Git-backed tracker designed for AI-supervised coding workflows.\n00006| \n00007| **Key Features:**\n00008| - Dependency-aware issue tracking\n00009| - Auto-sync with Git via JSONL\n00010| - AI-optimized CLI with JSON output\n00011| - Built-in daemon for background operations\n00012| - MCP server integration for Claude and other AI assistants\n00013| \n00014| **CRITICAL**: Use bd for ALL task tracking.

Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-ba2.5.4.2`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.2 --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-ba2.5.4.2-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-ba2.5.4.2-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.2 --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-ba2.5.4.2 --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file. Including a link to the PR. Provide hints on how to test any new functionality locally. Ask the user to review the PR and merge when ready.\n   - Ask the producer to provide feedback on the implementation and, if ready to do so, to instruct the agent to \"land the plane\" (merge the PR and close the issue)."},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/AGENTS.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| ## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)\n00002| \n00003| **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.\n00004| \n00005| ### Why bd?\n00006| \n00007| - Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues\n00008| - Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control\n00009| - Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links\n00010| - Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion\n00011| \n00012| ### Quick Start\n00013| \n00014| **Check for ready work:**\n00015| \n00016| ```bash\n00017| bd ready --json\n00018| ```\n00019| \n00020| **Create new issues:**\n00021| \n00022| ```bash\n00023| # For bugs and features, use templates for structured documentation\n00024| bd create \"Bug title\" --from-template bug -p 1 --json\n00025| bd create \"Feature title\" --from-template feature -p 2 --json\n00026| bd create \"Epic title\" --from-template epic -p 1 --json\n00027| \n00028| # For quick tasks/chores, skip templates\n00029| bd create \"Task title\" -t task -p 2 --json\n00030| bd create \"Chore title\" -t chore -p 3 --json\n00031| \n00032| # With dependencies or parent relationships\n00033| bd create \"Issue title\" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json\n00034| bd create \"Subtask\" --parent <epic-id> --json  # Hierarchical subtask (gets ID like epic-id.1)\n00035| ```\n00036| \n00037| **Claim and update:**\n00038| \n00039| ```bash\n00040| bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json\n00041| bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json\n00042| ```\n00043| \n00044| **Complete work:**\n00045| \n00046| ```bash\n00047| bd close bd-42 --reason \"Completed\" --json\n00048| ```\n00049| \n00050| ### Issue Types\n00051| \n00052| - `bug` - Something broken\n00053| - `feature` - New functionality\n00054| - `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)\n00055| - `epic` - Large feature with subtasks\n00056| - `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)\n00057| \n00058| ### Priorities\n00059| \n00060| - `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)\n00061| - `1` - High (major features, important bugs)\n00062| - `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)\n00063| - `3` - Low (polish, optimization)\n00064| - `4` - Backlog (future ideas)\n00065| \n00066| ### Workflow for AI Agents\n00067| \n00068| 1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues\n00069| 2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`\n00070| 3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document\n00071| 4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:\n00072|    - `bd create \"Found bug\" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`\n00073| 5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason \"Done\"`\n00074| 6. **Commit together**: Always commit the `.beads/issues.jsonl` file together with the code changes so issue state stays in sync with code state\n00075| \n00076| ### Using bv as an AI sidecar\n00077| \n00078| bv is a fast terminal UI for Beads projects (.beads/beads.jsonl). It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6.

Safety gate: handle dirty working tree\n\n   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).\n   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-ba2.5.4.`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-ba2.5.4. --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-ba2.5.4.-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-ba2.5.4.-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-ba2.5.4. --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-ba2.5.4. --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file.

It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6. Notify the producer that the PR is ready for review. Stop this process until the PR is reviewed and merged. Once reviewed and merged, proceed.\n00287| 7. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items\n00288| 8. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches\n00289| 9. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed\n00290| 10. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session\n00291| **CRITICAL RULES:**\n00292| \n00293| - Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds\n00294| - NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally\n00295| - NEVER say \"ready to push when you are\" - YOU must push\n00296| - If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds\n00297| - When using backticks in strings that are to be passed as arguments to shell commands (e.g. waif, gh), escape them properly to avoid errors\n00298| \n00299| ## Project structure\n00300| \n00301| - Source code lives in `src/`\n00302| - Tests live in `tests/`\n00303| - Documentation lives in `docs/`\n00304| - AI-generated planning docs go in `history/` (ephemeral)\n00305| - Beads configs live in `.beads/`\n00306| - Beads issues live in `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n00307| - OpenCode configs live in `.opencode`\n00308| - OpenCode agent commands live in `.opencode/command/` - these are not related to the WAFI CLI itself\n00309| \n\n(End of file - total 309 lines)\n</file>"},{"type":"file"},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/.github/copilot-instructions.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| # GitHub Copilot Instructions\n00002| \n00003| ## Issue Tracking with bd\n00004| \n00005| This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking - a Git-backed tracker designed for AI-supervised coding workflows.\n00006| \n00007| **Key Features:**\n00008| - Dependency-aware issue tracking\n00009| - Auto-sync with Git via JSONL\n00010| - AI-optimized CLI with JSON output\n00011| - Built-in daemon for background operations\n00012| - MCP server integration for Claude and other AI assistants\n00013| \n00014| **CRITICAL**: Use bd for ALL task tracking.

Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-ba2.5.4. --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-ba2.5.4.-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-ba2.5.4.-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-ba2.5.4. --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-ba2.5.4. --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file. Including a link to the PR. Provide hints on how to test any new functionality locally. Ask the user to review the PR and merge when ready.\n   - Ask the producer to provide feedback on the implementation and, if ready to do so, to instruct the agent to \"land the plane\" (merge the PR and close the issue)."},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/AGENTS.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| ## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)\n00002| \n00003| **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking.

It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6. Notify the producer that the PR is ready for review. Stop this process until the PR is reviewed and merged.

Safety gate: handle dirty working tree\n\n   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).\n   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-ba2.5.4.2`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.2 --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-ba2.5.4.2-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-ba2.5.4.2-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.2 --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-ba2.5.4.2 --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file. Including a link to the PR. Provide hints on how to test any new functionality locally. Ask the user to review the PR and merge when ready.\n   - Ask the producer to provide feedback on the implementation and, if ready to do so, to instruct the agent to \"land the plane\" (merge the PR and close the issue)."},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/AGENTS.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| ## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)\n00002| \n00003| **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking.

It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6. Notify the producer that the PR is ready for review. Stop this process until the PR is reviewed and merged. Once reviewed and merged, proceed.\n00287| 7. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items\n00288| 8. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches\n00289| 9. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed\n00290| 10. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session\n00291| **CRITICAL RULES:**\n00292| \n00293| - Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds\n00294| - NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally\n00295| - NEVER say \"ready to push when you are\" - YOU must push\n00296| - If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds\n00297| - When using backticks in strings that are to be passed as arguments to shell commands (e.g. waif, gh), escape them properly to avoid errors\n00298| \n00299| ## Project structure\n00300| \n00301| - Source code lives in `src/`\n00302| - Tests live in `tests/`\n00303| - Documentation lives in `docs/`\n00304| - AI-generated planning docs go in `history/` (ephemeral)\n00305| - Beads configs live in `.beads/`\n00306| - Beads issues live in `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n00307| - OpenCode configs live in `.opencode`\n00308| - OpenCode agent commands live in `.opencode/command/` - these are not related to the WAFI CLI itself\n00309| \n\n(End of file - total 309 lines)\n</file>"},{"type":"file"},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/.github/copilot-instructions.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| # GitHub Copilot Instructions\n00002| \n00003| ## Issue Tracking with bd\n00004| \n00005| This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking - a Git-backed tracker designed for AI-supervised coding workflows.\n00006| \n00007| **Key Features:**\n00008| - Dependency-aware issue tracking\n00009| - Auto-sync with Git via JSONL\n00010| - AI-optimized CLI with JSON output\n00011| - Built-in daemon for background operations\n00012| - MCP server integration for Claude and other AI assistants\n00013| \n00014| **CRITICAL**: Use bd for ALL task tracking.

Safety gate: handle dirty working tree\n\n   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).\n   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-ba2.5.4.2`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.2 --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-ba2.5.4.2-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-ba2.5.4.2-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.2 --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-ba2.5.4.2 --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file. Including a link to the PR. Provide hints on how to test any new functionality locally. Ask the user to review the PR and merge when ready.\n   - Ask the producer to provide feedback on the implementation and, if ready to do so, to instruct the agent to \"land the plane\" (merge the PR and close the issue)."},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/AGENTS.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| ## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)\n00002| \n00003| **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.\n00004| \n00005| ### Why bd?\n00006| \n00007| - Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues\n00008| - Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control\n00009| - Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links\n00010| - Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion\n00011| \n00012| ### Quick Start\n00013| \n00014| **Check for ready work:**\n00015| \n00016| ```bash\n00017| bd ready --json\n00018| ```\n00019| \n00020| **Create new issues:**\n00021| \n00022| ```bash\n00023| # For bugs and features, use templates for structured documentation\n00024| bd create \"Bug title\" --from-template bug -p 1 --json\n00025| bd create \"Feature title\" --from-template feature -p 2 --json\n00026| bd create \"Epic title\" --from-template epic -p 1 --json\n00027| \n00028| # For quick tasks/chores, skip templates\n00029| bd create \"Task title\" -t task -p 2 --json\n00030| bd create \"Chore title\" -t chore -p 3 --json\n00031| \n00032| # With dependencies or parent relationships\n00033| bd create \"Issue title\" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json\n00034| bd create \"Subtask\" --parent <epic-id> --json  # Hierarchical subtask (gets ID like epic-id.1)\n00035| ```\n00036| \n00037| **Claim and update:**\n00038| \n00039| ```bash\n00040| bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json\n00041| bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json\n00042| ```\n00043| \n00044| **Complete work:**\n00045| \n00046| ```bash\n00047| bd close bd-42 --reason \"Completed\" --json\n00048| ```\n00049| \n00050| ### Issue Types\n00051| \n00052| - `bug` - Something broken\n00053| - `feature` - New functionality\n00054| - `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)\n00055| - `epic` - Large feature with subtasks\n00056| - `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)\n00057| \n00058| ### Priorities\n00059| \n00060| - `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)\n00061| - `1` - High (major features, important bugs)\n00062| - `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)\n00063| - `3` - Low (polish, optimization)\n00064| - `4` - Backlog (future ideas)\n00065| \n00066| ### Workflow for AI Agents\n00067| \n00068| 1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues\n00069| 2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`\n00070| 3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document\n00071| 4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:\n00072|    - `bd create \"Found bug\" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`\n00073| 5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason \"Done\"`\n00074| 6. **Commit together**: Always commit the `.beads/issues.jsonl` file together with the code changes so issue state stays in sync with code state\n00075| \n00076| ### Using bv as an AI sidecar\n00077| \n00078| bv is a fast terminal UI for Beads projects (.beads/beads.jsonl). It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6.

the PM indirectly benefits via faster/safer agent execution.\\n\\nSuccess criteria\\n- `waif context` (alias: `waif ctx`) generates/updates a single agent-oriented “signpost” document: `docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md`.\\n- The context pack provides “minimum efficient” discovery:\\n  - Links to all important docs (PRDs/specs, user docs, workflow rules, issue tracking rules, agent roles, key source folders).\\n  - Each entry includes a short description (1–2 bullets) describing what it contains and when to read it.\\n  - Large docs may be referenced multiple times, pointing at specific sections.\\n- The pack avoids rapidly-changing content; instead it points to the canonical way to query it (e.g., it does not list active Beads issues, but explains how to query for ready/active work).\\n- Soft size limit: ~20,000 tokens.\\n  - If generation exceeds the limit, still write the file AND create/update a P0 Beads issue assigned to the PM flagging that the context pack has exceeded the target and needs strategy/partitioning.\\n\\nConstraints\\n- Ignore/redaction boundaries are defined by `.gitignore`.\\n  - Ignored content must not be included; “omitted but redacted” summaries are acceptable.\\n- Initial scope (this iteration): implement the `waif context|ctx` command to create/update the context pack.\\n- Out of scope (this iteration): defining/automating rules for when agents must file “request context update” issues after significant changes.\\n- This document is intended for agent consumption, not human consumption.\\n\\nExisting state (current behavior)\\n- `docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md` recommends a `context`/`ctx` command that generates `docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md`, but the command and template do not currently exist.\\n- Project structure/rules are spread across multiple docs; there is no single agent-first index.\\n\\nDesired change\\n- Implement/ship a CLI command `waif context` (alias `waif ctx`) that generates/updates `docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md` from a stable template.\\n- Ensure ignore boundary compliance via `.gitignore`.\\n- Implement the “20,000 token” soft limit behavior: write the file and create/update a P0 issue assigned to the PM when exceeded.\\n\\nLikely duplicates / related docs (file paths)\\n- docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md (mentions `context`/`ctx` utility command)\\n- docs/dev/TUI_PRD.md (mentions context sharing with OpenCode; ignore boundaries)\\n- docs/Workflow.md (workflow rules that the context pack should signpost)\\n- docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md (canonical Context Pack PRD)\\n\\nRelated issues (Beads ids)\\n- wf-7cn: Docs: Implement Context Pack command and template\\n- wf-ba2.5: Context Gathering + .gitignore Guards (epic)\\n- wf-ba2.5.1: .gitignore guards for reads + writes (hard enforcement)\\n- wf-ba2.5.2: Context selection strategy (eligible repo context)\\n- wf-ba2.9.4: Tests: .gitignore enforcement\\n- wf-ba2.5.5: Instruct agents to file context pack update requests\\n\\nClarifying questions\\n1. Minimum required section outline for `docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md` (top-level headings) so the generator stays stable?\\n2. How should “~20,000 tokens” be measured (approximate by characters/words, or via a tokenizer implementation)?\\n3. P0 issue strategy on overflow: one long-lived issue updated each time vs create a new P0 each time?\\n4. Should `waif ctx` enumerate PRDs/specs by scanning `docs/dev/*PRD*.md`, or rely on a curated allowlist?\\n5.

Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-ba2.5.4`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-ba2.5.4 --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-ba2.5.4-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-ba2.5.4-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-ba2.5.4 --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-ba2.5.4 --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file. Including a link to the PR. Provide hints on how to test any new functionality locally. Ask the user to review the PR and merge when ready.\n   - Ask the producer to provide feedback on the implementation and, if ready to do so, to instruct the agent to \"land the plane\" (merge the PR and close the issue)."},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/AGENTS.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| ## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)\n00002| \n00003| **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.\n00004| \n00005| ### Why bd?\n00006| \n00007| - Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues\n00008| - Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control\n00009| - Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links\n00010| - Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion\n00011| \n00012| ### Quick Start\n00013| \n00014| **Check for ready work:**\n00015| \n00016| ```bash\n00017| bd ready --json\n00018| ```\n00019| \n00020| **Create new issues:**\n00021| \n00022| ```bash\n00023| # For bugs and features, use templates for structured documentation\n00024| bd create \"Bug title\" --from-template bug -p 1 --json\n00025| bd create \"Feature title\" --from-template feature -p 2 --json\n00026| bd create \"Epic title\" --from-template epic -p 1 --json\n00027| \n00028| # For quick tasks/chores, skip templates\n00029| bd create \"Task title\" -t task -p 2 --json\n00030| bd create \"Chore title\" -t chore -p 3 --json\n00031| \n00032| # With dependencies or parent relationships\n00033| bd create \"Issue title\" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json\n00034| bd create \"Subtask\" --parent <epic-id> --json  # Hierarchical subtask (gets ID like epic-id.1)\n00035| ```\n00036| \n00037| **Claim and update:**\n00038| \n00039| ```bash\n00040| bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json\n00041| bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json\n00042| ```\n00043| \n00044| **Complete work:**\n00045| \n00046| ```bash\n00047| bd close bd-42 --reason \"Completed\" --json\n00048| ```\n00049| \n00050| ### Issue Types\n00051| \n00052| - `bug` - Something broken\n00053| - `feature` - New functionality\n00054| - `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)\n00055| - `epic` - Large feature with subtasks\n00056| - `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)\n00057| \n00058| ### Priorities\n00059| \n00060| - `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)\n00061| - `1` - High (major features, important bugs)\n00062| - `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)\n00063| - `3` - Low (polish, optimization)\n00064| - `4` - Backlog (future ideas)\n00065| \n00066| ### Workflow for AI Agents\n00067| \n00068| 1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues\n00069| 2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`\n00070| 3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document\n00071| 4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:\n00072|    - `bd create \"Found bug\" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`\n00073| 5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason \"Done\"`\n00074| 6. **Commit together**: Always commit the `.beads/issues.jsonl` file together with the code changes so issue state stays in sync with code state\n00075| \n00076| ### Using bv as an AI sidecar\n00077| \n00078| bv is a fast terminal UI for Beads projects (.beads/beads.jsonl). It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6.

the PM indirectly benefits via faster/safer agent execution.\\n\\nSuccess criteria\\n- `waif context` (alias: `waif ctx`) generates/updates a single agent-oriented “signpost” document: `docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md`.\\n- The context pack provides “minimum efficient” discovery:\\n  - Links to all important docs (PRDs/specs, user docs, workflow rules, issue tracking rules, agent roles, key source folders).\\n  - Each entry includes a short description (1–2 bullets) describing what it contains and when to read it.\\n  - Large docs may be referenced multiple times, pointing at specific sections.\\n- The pack avoids rapidly-changing content; instead it points to the canonical way to query it (e.g., it does not list active Beads issues, but explains how to query for ready/active work).\\n- Soft size limit: ~20,000 tokens.\\n  - If generation exceeds the limit, still write the file AND create/update a P0 Beads issue assigned to the PM flagging that the context pack has exceeded the target and needs strategy/partitioning.\\n\\nConstraints\\n- Ignore/redaction boundaries are defined by `.gitignore`.\\n  - Ignored content must not be included; “omitted but redacted” summaries are acceptable.\\n- Initial scope (this iteration): implement the `waif context|ctx` command to create/update the context pack.\\n- Out of scope (this iteration): defining/automating rules for when agents must file “request context update” issues after significant changes.\\n- This document is intended for agent consumption, not human consumption.\\n\\nExisting state (current behavior)\\n- `docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md` recommends a `context`/`ctx` command that generates `docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md`, but the command and template do not currently exist.\\n- Project structure/rules are spread across multiple docs; there is no single agent-first index.\\n\\nDesired change\\n- Implement/ship a CLI command `waif context` (alias `waif ctx`) that generates/updates `docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md` from a stable template.\\n- Ensure ignore boundary compliance via `.gitignore`.\\n- Implement the “20,000 token” soft limit behavior: write the file and create/update a P0 issue assigned to the PM when exceeded.\\n\\nLikely duplicates / related docs (file paths)\\n- docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md (mentions `context`/`ctx` utility command)\\n- docs/dev/TUI_PRD.md (mentions context sharing with OpenCode; ignore boundaries)\\n- docs/Workflow.md (workflow rules that the context pack should signpost)\\n- docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md (canonical Context Pack PRD)\\n\\nRelated issues (Beads ids)\\n- wf-7cn: Docs: Implement Context Pack command and template\\n- wf-ba2.5: Context Gathering + .gitignore Guards (epic)\\n- wf-ba2.5.1: .gitignore guards for reads + writes (hard enforcement)\\n- wf-ba2.5.2: Context selection strategy (eligible repo context)\\n- wf-ba2.9.4: Tests: .gitignore enforcement\\n- wf-ba2.5.5: Instruct agents to file context pack update requests\\n\\nClarifying questions\\n1. Minimum required section outline for `docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md` (top-level headings) so the generator stays stable?\\n2. How should “~20,000 tokens” be measured (approximate by characters/words, or via a tokenizer implementation)?\\n3. P0 issue strategy on overflow: one long-lived issue updated each time vs create a new P0 each time?\\n4. Should `waif ctx` enumerate PRDs/specs by scanning `docs/dev/*PRD*.md`, or rely on a curated allowlist?\\n5.

Safety gate: handle dirty working tree\n\n   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).\n   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-ba2.5.4`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-ba2.5.4 --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-ba2.5.4-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-ba2.5.4-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-ba2.5.4 --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-ba2.5.4 --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file.

It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6. Notify the producer that the PR is ready for review. Stop this process until the PR is reviewed and merged. Once reviewed and merged, proceed.\n00287| 7. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items\n00288| 8. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches\n00289| 9. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed\n00290| 10. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session\n00291| **CRITICAL RULES:**\n00292| \n00293| - Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds\n00294| - NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally\n00295| - NEVER say \"ready to push when you are\" - YOU must push\n00296| - If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds\n00297| - When using backticks in strings that are to be passed as arguments to shell commands (e.g. waif, gh), escape them properly to avoid errors\n00298| \n00299| ## Project structure\n00300| \n00301| - Source code lives in `src/`\n00302| - Tests live in `tests/`\n00303| - Documentation lives in `docs/`\n00304| - AI-generated planning docs go in `history/` (ephemeral)\n00305| - Beads configs live in `.beads/`\n00306| - Beads issues live in `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n00307| - OpenCode configs live in `.opencode`\n00308| - OpenCode agent commands live in `.opencode/command/` - these are not related to the WAFI CLI itself\n00309| \n\n(End of file - total 309 lines)\n</file>"},{"type":"file"},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/.github/copilot-instructions.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| # GitHub Copilot Instructions\n00002| \n00003| ## Issue Tracking with bd\n00004| \n00005| This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking - a Git-backed tracker designed for AI-supervised coding workflows.\n00006| \n00007| **Key Features:**\n00008| - Dependency-aware issue tracking\n00009| - Auto-sync with Git via JSONL\n00010| - AI-optimized CLI with JSON output\n00011| - Built-in daemon for background operations\n00012| - MCP server integration for Claude and other AI assistants\n00013| \n00014| **CRITICAL**: Use bd for ALL task tracking.

How should “~20,000 tokens” be measured (approximate by characters/words, or via a tokenizer implementation)?\\n3.

Safety gate: handle dirty working tree\n\n   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).\n   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-ba2.5.4.3`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.3 --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-ba2.5.4.3-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-ba2.5.4.3-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.3 --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-ba2.5.4.3 --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file. Including a link to the PR. Provide hints on how to test any new functionality locally. Ask the user to review the PR and merge when ready.\n   - Ask the producer to provide feedback on the implementation and, if ready to do so, to instruct the agent to \"land the plane\" (merge the PR and close the issue)."},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/AGENTS.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| ## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)\n00002| \n00003| **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking.

It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below.

Safety gate: handle dirty working tree\n\n   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).\n   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.\n   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:\n     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).\n     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate \"prep\" branch).\n     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).\n     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).\n     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.\n\n1. Understand the issue\n\n   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.\n   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.\n   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.\n\n1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)\n\n    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.\n\n    Minimum definition checklist:\n\n    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope\n    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)\n    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)\n    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)\n\n    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:\n\n    - Stop implementation.\n    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.\n       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.\n       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `wf-ba2.5.4.3`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.\n       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:\n          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.\n          - Example: `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.3 --description \"<intake brief markdown>\" --json`\n          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.\n    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.\n\n2. Create a working branch\n\n   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.\n   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/wf-ba2.5.4.3-<short-suffix>` or `bug/wf-ba2.5.4.3-<short-suffix>`.\n   - Do not commit directly on `main`.\n\n3. Claim the issue\n\n   - Run `bd update wf-ba2.5.4.3 --status in_progress --assignee \"$USER\" --json`.\n   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.\n\n4. Implement\n\n   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.\n   - Make the code changes.\n   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:wf-ba2.5.4.3 --json`.\n   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour\n   - Document the changes in the project documentation\n\n5. Validate\n\n   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).\n\n6. Update the docs\n\n   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.\n   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.\n   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.\n   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.\n\n7. Commit\n\n   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).\n   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.\n\n8. Update Beads (do not close)\n\n   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.\n   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.\n   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.\n     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.\n   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file.

It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.\n00079| \n00080| _IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!_\n00081| \n00082| - bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.\n00083| - bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.\n00084| - bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.\n00085| - bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.\n00086| - bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.\n00087| - bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.\n00088| \n00089| Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.\n00090| \n00091| ### Auto-Sync\n00092| \n00093| bd automatically syncs with git:\n00094| \n00095| - Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\n00096| - Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\n00097| - No manual export/import needed!\n00098| \n00099| ### GitHub Copilot Integration\n00100| \n00101| If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.\n00102| Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.\n00103| \n00104| ### MCP Server (Recommended)\n00105| \n00106| If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:\n00107| \n00108| ```bash\n00109| pip install beads-mcp\n00110| ```\n00111| \n00112| Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):\n00113| \n00114| ```json\n00115| {\n00116|   \"beads\": {\n00117|     \"command\": \"beads-mcp\",\n00118|     \"args\": []\n00119|   }\n00120| }\n00121| ```\n00122| \n00123| Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.\n00124| \n00125| ### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\n00126| \n00127| AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:\n00128| \n00129| - PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md\n00130| - DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md\n00131| - TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files\n00132| \n00133| **Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**\n00134| \n00135| **Recommended approach:**\n00136| \n00137| - Create a `history/` directory in the project root\n00138| - Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\n00139| - Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\n00140| - Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\n00141| \n00142| **Example .gitignore entry (optional):**\n00143| \n00144| ```\n00145| # AI planning documents (ephemeral)\n00146| history/\n00147| ```\n00148| \n00149| **Benefits:**\n00150| \n00151| - ✅ Clean repository root\n00152| - ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\n00153| - ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired\n00154| - ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research\n00155| - ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\n00156| \n00157| ### Templates\n00158| \n00159| Beads provides structured templates for better documentation:\n00160| \n00161| - **bug**: Includes steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, root cause analysis\n00162| - **feature**: Includes motivation, use cases, technical design, alternatives considered\n00163| - **epic**: Includes overview, success criteria, scope, architecture, dependencies\n00164| \n00165| **When to use templates:**\n00166| \n00167| - ✅ Use `--from-template bug` for all bug reports (better debugging context)\n00168| - ✅ Use `--from-template feature` for new features (captures design decisions)\n00169| - ✅ Use `--from-template epic` for large multi-issue projects\n00170| - ❌ Skip templates for quick tasks/chores (unnecessary overhead)\n00171| \n00172| **View templates:**\n00173| \n00174| ```bash\n00175| bd template list --json\n00176| bd template show bug --json\n00177| ```\n00178| \n00179| ### CLI Help\n00180| \n00181| Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.\n00182| For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.\n00183| \n00184| ### Important Rules\n00185| \n00186| - ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\n00187| - ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use\n00188| - ✅ Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\n00189| - ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies\n00190| - ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \"what should I work on?\"\n00191| - ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\n00192| - ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags\n00193| - ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\n00194| - ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\n00195| - ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\n00196| - ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\n00197| \n00198| For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.\n00199| \n00200| <!-- bv-agent-instructions-v1 -->\n00201| \n00202| ---\n00203| \n00204| ## Beads Workflow Integration\n00205| \n00206| This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.\n00207| \n00208| ### Essential Commands\n00209| \n00210| ```bash\n00211| # View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)\n00212| bv\n00213| \n00214| # CLI commands for agents (use these instead)\n00215| bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n00216| bd list --status=open # All open issues\n00217| bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies\n00218| bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --priority=2\n00219| bd update <id> --status=in_progress\n00220| bd close <id> --reason=\"Completed\"\n00221| bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once\n00222| bd sync               # Commit and push changes\n00223| ```\n00224| \n00225| ### Workflow Pattern\n00226| \n00227| 1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work\n00228| 2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`\n00229| 3. **Work**: Implement the task on a branch named with the bd id (see naming conventions)\n00230| 4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`\n00231| 5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end\n00232| \n00233| Branch guidance (branch-per-bd):\n00234| \n00235| - All work MUST be performed on branches that include the bd id. Create a short-lived topic branch from `origin/main` for each bd issue.\n00236| - If a branch already exists for the bd issue, reuse it and record your involvement in bd comments.\n00237| - Agents and humans should avoid editing files that other agents have claimed in bd unless coordination is documented.\n00238| \n00239| ### Key Concepts\n00240| \n00241| - **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.\n00242| - **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)\n00243| - **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs\n00244| - **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies\n00245| \n00246| ### Session Protocol\n00247| \n00248| **Before ending any session, run this checklist:**\n00249| \n00250| ```bash\n00251| git status              # Check what changed\n00252| git add <files>         # Stage code changes\n00253| bd sync                 # Commit beads changes\n00254| git commit -m \"...\"     # Commit code\n00255| bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes\n00256| git push                # Push to remote\n00257| ```\n00258| \n00259| ### Best Practices\n00260| \n00261| - Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work\n00262| - Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)\n00263| - Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks\n00264| - Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type\n00265| - Always `bd sync` before ending session\n00266| \n00267| <!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->\n00268| \n00269| ## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n00270| \n00271| **When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.\n00272| \n00273| **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**\n00274| \n00275| 1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up\n00276| 2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds, stop the landing if a test fails\n00277| 3. **Document changes** - Update docs, changelogs, comments\n00278| 4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:\n00279|    ```bash\n00280|    git pull --rebase\n00281|    bd sync\n00282|    git push\n00283|    git status  # MUST show \"up to date with origin\"\n00284|    ```\n00285| 5. **Raise a PR** (if applicable, ask if unsure) - Link to issues and update the BD with a link to the PR.\n00286| 6. Notify the producer that the PR is ready for review. Stop this process until the PR is reviewed and merged. Once reviewed and merged, proceed.\n00287| 7. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items\n00288| 8. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches\n00289| 9. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed\n00290| 10. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session\n00291| **CRITICAL RULES:**\n00292| \n00293| - Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds\n00294| - NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally\n00295| - NEVER say \"ready to push when you are\" - YOU must push\n00296| - If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds\n00297| - When using backticks in strings that are to be passed as arguments to shell commands (e.g. waif, gh), escape them properly to avoid errors\n00298| \n00299| ## Project structure\n00300| \n00301| - Source code lives in `src/`\n00302| - Tests live in `tests/`\n00303| - Documentation lives in `docs/`\n00304| - AI-generated planning docs go in `history/` (ephemeral)\n00305| - Beads configs live in `.beads/`\n00306| - Beads issues live in `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n00307| - OpenCode configs live in `.opencode`\n00308| - OpenCode agent commands live in `.opencode/command/` - these are not related to the WAFI CLI itself\n00309| \n\n(End of file - total 309 lines)\n</file>"},{"type":"file"},{"type":"text","text":"Called the Read tool with the following input: {\"filePath\":\"/home/rgardler/projects/waif/.github/copilot-instructions.md\"}"},{"type":"text","text":"<file>\n00001| # GitHub Copilot Instructions\n00002| \n00003| ## Issue Tracking with bd\n00004| \n00005| This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking - a Git-backed tracker designed for AI-supervised coding workflows.\n00006| \n00007| **Key Features:**\n00008| - Dependency-aware issue tracking\n00009| - Auto-sync with Git via JSONL\n00010| - AI-optimized CLI with JSON output\n00011| - Built-in daemon for background operations\n00012| - MCP server integration for Claude and other AI assistants\n00013| \n00014| **CRITICAL**: Use bd for ALL task tracking.

Repo search (agent responsibility)\n\n   Use the user’s answers to derive 2–6 keywords. Then search for related artifacts.\n\n   - Search `docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md` if present, Otherwise, scan `docs/`, `README.md`, and other high-level files for relevant context about the product/repo.\n     - Use ripgrep where available (where not available use an alternative, but ask the user to install ripgrep).\n     - Examples:\n       - `rg -n \"Product Requirements Document|\\bPRD\\b\" docs/`\n       - `rg -n \"<keyword1>|<keyword2>\" docs/ src/ README.md`\n   - Search for related Beads issues covering this topic (duplicates / precursors):\n     - Examples:\n       - `bd list --status open --json | rg -i \"<keyword>\"`\n       - `bd ready --json | rg -i \"<keyword>\"`\n     - If `rg` is unavailable, use a best-effort alternative and ask the user to install ripgrep.\n     - If you find candidates:\n       - List them as \"Related issues\" (ids + titles).\n       - If one clearly already represents this work, prefer updating that issue (or creating a child issue) instead of creating a duplicate.\n   - If you find candidates:\n     - List them as \"Likely duplicates / related docs\".\n     - Ask the user to confirm whether to update one of them.\n\n3. Beads search (agent responsibility)\n\n   Search existing issues for overlaps.\n\n   - Use Beads as the source of truth.\n   - Suggested approaches (pick the simplest available in the environment):\n     - `bd list --status open --json | rg -i \"<keyword>\"`\n     - If `rg` is unavailable, ask the user whether you should do a broad manual scan (and suggest the user installs ripgrep).\n\n   Output:\n\n   - \"Related issues\" list (ids + titles) OR explicitly state \"No obvious related issues found\".\n\n4. Clarifying questions (agent responsibility)\n\n   Produce a short list (0–7) of clarifying questions that would unblock PRD creation/editing.\n   Keep them actionable and specific.\n\n5. Decide next step: NEW PRD vs UPDATE\n\n   Decide, then confirm with the user:\n\n   - If UPDATE: identify the file path to update (ask for confirmation if uncertain).\n   - If NEW: propose a PRD file path under `docs/dev/`.\n     - Convention: `docs/dev/<feature>_PRD.md`.\n\n6. Feedback Gate\n\n  Propose the description of the bead, priority level, parent, related isses etc.\n\n  Ask the user if there are any clarifictions, changes or further research required before proceeding. Carry out any further instructtions before proceeding. \n\n  Only proceed to the next step if the user gives permission to do so.\n\n7. Draft the intake brief (agent responsibility)\n\n   Compile all gathered information into a well-structured intake brief in Markdown format.\n\n   Use the following template:\n\n   - Problem\n   - Users\n   - Success criteria\n   - Constraints\n   - Existing state (if applicable)\n   - Desired change (if applicable)\n   - Likely duplicates / related docs (file paths)\n   - Related issues (Beads ids)\n   - Clarifying questions\n   - Proposed next step:\n     - `NEW PRD` at: `<path>` OR\n     - `UPDATE PRD` at: `<path>`\n     - Recommended next command: `/prd <path> <new-issue-id>`\n\n8. Review 1 (agent responsibility)\n\n  Complete the **first full draft** of this workflow artifact for the current work item.\n  - Be creative and propose strong defaults.\n  - If uncertain, present 2-3 alternatives and choose one, explaining why.\n  - Keep it actionable: concrete lists, commands, checklists, and examples.\n  - Assume the reader wants momentum; do not over-polish yet.\n\n9. Review 2 (agent responsibilitY)\n\n  Review the full draft for completeness, clarity, and actionability.\n  - Ensure all required sections are present and well-structured.\n  - Verify that all user-provided content is accurately captured.\n  - Check for consistency in terminology and formatting.\n  - Refine language for clarity and conciseness.\n  - Ensure the proposed next steps are clear and actionable.\n\n10. Review 3 (Agent responsibility)\n\n  Audit the current artifact for correctness and real-world usability.\n  - Add missing constraints, assumptions, and decision points.\n  - Add edge cases, failure modes, and \"what could go wrong\" notes.\n  - Ensure steps are testable/verifiable.\n  - Remove anything not serving the artifact purpose.\n\n11. Review 4 (Agent responsibility)\n\n  Polish the artifact for clarity and fast reading.\n  - Rewrite unclear sections and tighten wording.\n  - Convert paragraphs into bullets/checklists where helpful.\n  - Normalize terminology and naming.\n  - Ensure examples/commands are copy-pastable and consistent.\n\n12. Finak Review (Agent responsibility)\n\n  Perform a final QA review of the artifact.\n  - Check for internal consistency and contradictions.\n  - Ensure it aligns with repo conventions and the Workflow doc.\n  - Ensure every requirement is actionable and measurable.\n  - Emit a final “ready” version with a small list of remaining open questions (if any).\n\n13. Create or update the Beads issue (must do)\n\n   Create a new Beads issue, or update an existing issue, so that the description contains the full intake brief and links.\n\n   - Type: `feature`\n   - Priority: default to `2` unless the user indicates urgency/risk.\n   - Title: `<descriptive working title>`\n\n   The description must contain the final intake brief in Markdown format.\n\n   If there is a suitable parent issue then create the new issue as a sub-issue (use `--parent <id>`).\n\n   - Problem\n   - Users\n   - Success criteria\n   - Constraints\n   - Existing state (if applicable)\n   - Desired change (if applicable)\n   - Likely duplicates / related docs (file paths)\n   - Related issues (Beads ids)\n   - Clarifying questions\n   - Proposed next step:\n     - `NEW PRD` at: `<path>` OR\n     - `UPDATE PRD` at: `<path>`\n     - Recommended next command: `/prd <path> <new-issue-id>`\n\n   If there is a suitable parent issue then create the new issue as a sub-issue (use `--parent <id>`).\n\n   If there are `Related issues`, link them using `bd dep add [issue-id] [depends-on-id] --type related`.\n\n   If this issue is blocked by another then this should be recorded with `bd dep add [issue-id] [depends-on-id] --type blocks`.\n\n14.

Review 3 (Agent responsibility)\n\n  Audit the current artifact for correctness and real-world usability.\n  - Add missing constraints, assumptions, and decision points.\n  - Add edge cases, failure modes, and \"what could go wrong\" notes.\n  - Ensure steps are testable/verifiable.\n  - Remove anything not serving the artifact purpose.\n\n  Output a summary of any changes made during this review.\n\n11. Review 4 (Agent responsibility)\n\n  Polish the artifact for clarity and fast reading.\n  - Rewrite unclear sections and tighten wording.\n  - Convert paragraphs into bullets/checklists where helpful.\n  - Normalize terminology and naming.\n  - Ensure examples/commands are copy-pastable and consistent.\n\n  Output a summary of any changes made during this review.\n\n12. Final Review (Agent responsibility)\n\n  Perform a final QA review of the artifact.\n  - Check for internal consistency and contradictions.\n  - Ensure it aligns with repo conventions and the Workflow doc.\n  - Ensure every requirement is actionable and measurable.\n  - Emit a final “ready” version with a small list of remaining open questions (if any).\n\n  Output a summary of any changes made during this review, followed by the final artifact content.\n\n13. Create or update the Beads issue (must do)\n\n   Create a new Beads issue, or update an existing issue, so that the description contains the full intake brief and links.\n\n   - Type: `feature`\n   - Priority: default to `2` unless the user indicates urgency/risk.\n   - Title: `<descriptive working title>`\n\n   The description must contain the final intake brief in Markdown format.\n\n   If there is a suitable parent issue then create the new issue as a sub-issue (use `--parent <id>`).\n\n   - Problem\n   - Users\n   - Success criteria\n   - Constraints\n   - Existing state (if applicable)\n   - Desired change (if applicable)\n   - Likely duplicates / related docs (file paths)\n   - Related issues (Beads ids)\n   - Clarifying questions\n   - Proposed next step:\n     - `NEW PRD` at: `<path>` OR\n     - `UPDATE PRD` at: `<path>`\n     - Recommended next command: `/prd <path> <new-issue-id>`\n\n   If there is a suitable parent issue then create the new issue as a sub-issue (use `--parent <id>`).\n\n   If there are `Related issues`, link them using `bd dep add [issue-id] [depends-on-id] --type related`.\n\n   If this issue is blocked by another then this should be recorded with `bd dep add [issue-id] [depends-on-id] --type blocks`.\n\n14.

Work to perform autonomously:\n\n1) Edit docs/dev/workflow_stage_tracking_PRD.md to add a new section titled \"Per-bead worklog & state\" that defines a concise, line-oriented worklog format and guidance for storing it in beads. Follow these acceptance criteria (copied from bd wf-rjh):\n  - Define a concise line-oriented worklog format: ISO 8601 UTC timestamp, actor, short action, resulting state, optional link/reference. Example: \"2025-12-31T20:00:00Z @alice claim -> in_progress #link-to-bd\"\n  - Define canonical place to store the worklog: a bead comment block prefixed with \"WORKLOG:\" (preferred for human-readable audit) and also define bead metadata fields \"worklog\" (array) and \"workflow_state\" (single value) for tool consumption. Explain when to use a comment vs metadata.\n  - Provide 3 realistic example entries: claim/in_progress, handoff, close. Include a full sample bead comment block showing multiple entries.\n  - Recommend length/char limits (e.g., 200 chars per entry), privacy guidance (avoid secrets), and retention guidance (keep entries concise; archive if large) \n  - Add a short 'Usage checklist for agents' with steps agents must follow when updating beads: add a worklog entry, set workflow_state metadata, add discovered-from/deps if needed, and add a bd comment referencing edited files.\n  - Provide one-paragraph rationale for the change.\n\n2) Update staging: commit the change on the current branch (wf-rjh/add-worklog-prd) with message \"docs(prd): add per-bead worklog & workflow_state convention (wf-rjh)\".\n\n3) Create a GitHub PR using gh with title \"docs(prd): add per-bead worklog & workflow_state convention (wf-rjh)\" and a PR body that includes:\n  - Summary bullet points of what's changed\n  - The one-paragraph rationale\n  - Link/reference to bd wf-rjh\n  - Note that branch includes pre-existing edit .opencode/command/intake.md\n\n4) Return the PR URL and list of files changed.\n\nConstraints:\n- Update only docs/dev/workflow_stage_tracking_PRD.md (plus commits and PR).

Work to perform autonomously:\n\n1) Edit docs/dev/workflow_stage_tracking_PRD.md to add a new section titled \"Per-bead worklog & state\" that defines a concise, line-oriented worklog format and guidance for storing it in beads. Follow these acceptance criteria (copied from bd wf-rjh):\n  - Define a concise line-oriented worklog format: ISO 8601 UTC timestamp, actor, short action, resulting state, optional link/reference. Example: \"2025-12-31T20:00:00Z @alice claim -> in_progress #link-to-bd\"\n  - Define canonical place to store the worklog: a bead comment block prefixed with \"WORKLOG:\" (preferred for human-readable audit) and also define bead metadata fields \"worklog\" (array) and \"workflow_state\" (single value) for tool consumption. Explain when to use a comment vs metadata.\n  - Provide 3 realistic example entries: claim/in_progress, handoff, close. Include a full sample bead comment block showing multiple entries.\n  - Recommend length/char limits (e.g., 200 chars per entry), privacy guidance (avoid secrets), and retention guidance (keep entries concise; archive if large) \n  - Add a short 'Usage checklist for agents' with steps agents must follow when updating beads: add a worklog entry, set workflow_state metadata, add discovered-from/deps if needed, and add a bd comment referencing edited files.\n  - Provide one-paragraph rationale for the change.\n\n2) Update staging: commit the change on the current branch (wf-rjh/add-worklog-prd) with message \"docs(prd): add per-bead worklog & workflow_state convention (wf-rjh)\".\n\n3) Create a GitHub PR using gh with title \"docs(prd): add per-bead worklog & workflow_state convention (wf-rjh)\" and a PR body that includes:\n  - Summary bullet points of what's changed\n  - The one-paragraph rationale\n  - Link/reference to bd wf-rjh\n  - Note that branch includes pre-existing edit .opencode/command/intake.md\n\n4) Return the PR URL and list of files changed.\n\nConstraints:\n- Update only docs/dev/workflow_stage_tracking_PRD.md (plus commits and PR). Do not change other files besides staging committed earlier (.opencode and .beads already committed).\n- Ensure PR references bd wf-rjh in the body.\n- If gh CLI is unavailable, prepare the PR body and stop; report what you would run.\n\nRespond with only a JSON object containing keys: status (success|failed), pr_url (string|null), files_changed (array of paths), message (short human-readable)."}]}}

Requiring updates through the bd CLI standardizes how changes are recorded and avoids accidental overwrites of unrelated notes or metadata that other tools rely on.\n\n## Next steps\n\n- Gather canonical stage list and permissions.\n- Prototype with issue  field + linked chore for history.\n- Implement  CLI and tests.\n\nEnd of new content.\n\nCommit\n- Create a single commit that stages only docs/dev/workflow_stage_tracking_PRD.md\n- Commit message: \"docs(wf-rjh): align stage tracking PRD tokens with Workflow named steps\"\n- Do NOT include .beads/issues.jsonl or any other files in the commit.\n- Do NOT push to origin.\n\nPost-commit reporting (return these):\n- Which git branch you were on and current HEAD commit (hash + subject)\n- git status --porcelain after the commit\n- The one-line git log -1 output for the new commit\n- A unified diff of the committed change (git show --pretty=oneline --name-only and git --no-pager show --name-only HEAD and git --no-pager show HEAD --patch)\n- List of files modified\n- Any errors or abort reasons\n\nIf any pre-check fails (e.g., unexpected unstaged changes), abort and return the status and list of files to be fixed. Do not make any changes.\n\nReturn a concise summary and the exact commands you ran.\n"}]}}
