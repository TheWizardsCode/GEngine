Handoff to Patch (Implementation AI):

Summary:
- Purpose: Remove legacy '/implement' slash-command references and make the implement-skill standalone (invoked as `implement <bead-id>`).
- I updated the skill SKILL.md to remove slash-command aliasing: .opencode/skill/implement-skill/SKILL.md (edited).

Work to do (acceptance criteria):
1) Replace or remove all occurrences of the legacy '/implement' token in repository docs and command guidance so they reference the implement skill as `implement` (no leading slash) or indicate the CLI form `waif implement <Issue ID` where appropriate.
2) Ensure .opencode/skill/implement-skill/SKILL.md remains present and correct.
3) Create a short PR on branch implement-skill/remove-slash-alias (do NOT merge) with the edits.
4) Update any workflow/runbook docs that instruct users to type `/implement`.
5) Add a bd comment summarizing files changed and any follow-up beads created.

Files discovered with references (non-exhaustive):
- .opencode/command/implement.md  (update required)
- docs/dev/Workflow.md            (update required)
- .opencode/command/wf-help.md    (update required)
- docs/dev/gdd-template.md        (mentions commands)
- .beads/issues.jsonl              (contains an issue referencing `/implement` - do NOT edit this file directly)

Notes/constraints and risks:
- Do NOT edit .beads/issues.jsonl directly. Use bd to create any new beads.
- Preserve existing semantics: invoking the implement skill must update existing beads by id (do not change bd update semantics).
- Risk: external integrations or bot configs expecting leading slash tokens may rely on that form. Search for runtime code or bot config that strips leading slashes and validate behavior after edits.

Recommended steps for implementer:
1) Create branch implement-skill/remove-slash-alias from origin/main.
2) Run a repo-wide search for '/implement' and also for patterns like "implement <Issue ID>" to update docs consistently.
3) Edit the files listed above, run tests/linters, and open PR.
4) If changes affect runtime code (parsers, CLI helpers, bot handlers), add short notes in the PR and create follow-up beads if the change expands scope.
