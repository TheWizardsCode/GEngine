description: Implement a beads issue by id
agent: build
#model: GPT-5.1-Codex-max
---

You are implementing a Beads issue in this repository.

Argument handling:

- The user should run this as `/implement <bd-id>`.
- Use `$1` as the Beads ID.
- If `$1` is empty/undefined, ask for the missing id and stop.

Project rules (must follow):

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking; do not create markdown TODOs.
- Keep changes minimal and scoped to the issue.
- Validate changes with the most relevant tests/commands available.
- Use a git branch + PR workflow (no direct-to-main changes).
- Ensure the working branch is pushed to `origin` before you finish.
- Do NOT close the Beads issue until the PR is merged.

Context files:

- Tracker workflow: @AGENTS.md
- Copilot rules: @.github/copilot-instructions.md

Live context (do not guess; use this output):

- Current issue JSON: !`bd show $1 --json`
- Git status: !`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`
- Current branch: !`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
- Origin remote: !`git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null || echo "(no origin remote)"`
- Default origin branch (best effort): !`git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null || true`

Process:

0. Safety gate: handle dirty working tree

   - Before making any changes, check whether the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain=v1 -b`).
   - If there are _any_ uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop and ask the user what to do**. Do not assume changes are irrelevant.
   - Offer clear options and wait for an explicit choice:
     - A) Carry changes into this issue branch (continue as-is).
     - B) Commit current changes first (either on current branch or a separate "prep" branch).
     - C) Stash changes (and confirm whether to pop later).
     - D) Revert/discard changes (only with explicit confirmation).
     - E) Abort implementation so the user can inspect.

1. Understand the issue

   - Restate the acceptance criteria and constraints from the issue JSON.
   - Identify dependencies/blockers; if blocked, explain what is missing and ask the user how to proceed.
   - Review the issue `description`, `notes`, and any `comments` for references to PRDs, implementation plans, or other linked docs; if present, open and read those sources before proceeding.

1.1 Definition gate (must do before implementation)

    Before writing any code, confirm the Beads issue is sufficiently well-defined to implement.

    Minimum definition checklist:

    - Clear scope: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope
    - Concrete acceptance criteria (testable, not just aspirational)
    - Constraints/compatibility expectations (if any)
    - Obvious unknowns captured as questions (or resolved)

    If the issue is not sufficiently defined:

    - Stop implementation.
    - Work through the **intake brief interview** first to fully define the work.
       - Use `.opencode/command/intake.md` as the guide for the questions and searches.
       - IMPORTANT: when intake is performed as part of `/implement`, it must **always update the existing issue `$1`**. Do **not** create a new Beads issue.
       - After the intake interview + repo/Beads search, update the current issue so it becomes actionable:
          - Prefer updating the issue `description` and/or `acceptance` with the intake brief output.
          - Example: `bd update $1 --description "<intake brief markdown>" --json`
          - Ensure the updated issue contains: problem, users, success criteria, constraints, related docs/issues, clarifying questions, and testable acceptance criteria.
    - Only resume `/implement` once the work item is clearly actionable.

2. Create a working branch

   - If you are already on a topic branch for this issue, or a parent of this issue, keep it.
   - Otherwise create a new branch named like `feature/$1-<short-suffix>` or `bug/$1-<short-suffix>`.
   - Do not commit directly on `main`.

3. Claim the issue

   - Run `bd update $1 --status in_progress --assignee "$USER" --json`.
   - If `--assignee` is not accepted in this environment, rerun without it.

4. Implement

   - Identify the smallest set of files to change.
   - Make the code changes.
   - If you discover additional required work, create new linked issues using `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:$1 --json`.
   - Author appropriate tests that validate the intended behaviour
   - Document the changes in the project documentation

5. Validate

   - Run the most specific checks available for the changed area (tests/lint/build).

6. Update the docs

   - If the issue has linked PRDs or design docs, update them with a summary of the work done, and references to imprtant files altered during the work.
   - Update the `docs/workflow.md` if the issue changes any part of the development workflow.
   - Update any relevant README.md files to reflect changes in usage, setup, or configuration.
   - Update any documents linked from `workflow.md` that are affected by the changes made in this issue.

7. Commit

   - Commit your code changes on the branch (include the Beads id in the commit message).
   - Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive.

8. Update Beads (do not close)

   - Update the issue to include the PR URL using `--external-ref` and/or `--notes`.
   - Keep the issue in `in_progress` until the PR is merged.
   - Run `bd sync` before ending the session.
     - If there are no Beads changes to commit (or you are on an ephemeral branch without upstream), use `bd sync --flush-only`.
   - Output a summary of the goal of the issue and the work done, including a brief summary of changes to each file. Including a link to the PR. Provide hints on how to test any new functionality locally. Ask the user to review the PR and merge when ready.
   - Ask the producer to provide feedback on the implementation and, if ready to do so, to instruct the agent to "land the plane" (merge the PR and close the issue).
